I'm Hongsup (홍섭) and I am a Principal ML Research Engineer at Arm. Until recently, I also volunteered at Texas Justice Initiative, a criminal justice non-profit in Austin. My background is computational neuroscience (PhD) and behavioral ecology (MSc). Also, I'm a native speaker of Korean. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:hongsup.shin@pm.me).
