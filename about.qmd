I'm Hongsup (홍섭) and I am a Principal ML Research Engineer at Arm. I am interested in ML Ops, responsible AI, and AI ethics. My background is computational neuroscience (PhD) and behavioral ecology (MSc). Here are some examples of my work:

- [IEEE System-on-Chip 2022 paper on data-centric ML in hardware engineering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9908095)
- [Scipy 2019 paper on ML Ops case study of building ML apps for hardware verification](https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2019/Hongsup_Shin.html)
- [Police shooting analysis in Texas 2016-2019 report (collaboration with Texas Justice Initiative)](https://texasjusticeinitiative.org/publications/officer-involved-shootings-in-texas)
- [Medium post on simulationg relationship between talent, luck, and meritocracy](https://medium.com/@hongsupshin/talent-luck-and-success-simulating-meritocracy-and-inequality-with-stochasticity-501e0c1b4969)
- [PNAS paper on human visual short-term memory from my PhD thesis](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1117465109)

I try to participate in volunteering whenever I can. Until recently, I was a volunteer data scientist at [Texas Justice Initiative](https://texasjusticeinitiative.org/), a criminal justice non-profit in Austin, TX. I've also been a volunteer reviwer for various organizations such as [SciPy](https://conference.scipy.org/), [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/), and [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/).

I love sharing ideas with others and I am interested in building communities. I've oragnized [Austin ML Journal Club](https://austinmljournalclub.github.io/), and participated in various local meetups such as [Women in Data Science-ATX](https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Data-Science-ATX/) and [Austin Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/austinpython/).
