    "text": "As a data scientist working in industry, I frequently witness the impact a machine learning application can make. This impact often has a cascade of downstream effects which are inconceivable to a data scientist without enough domain knowledge. Nevertheless, under the widespread motto, “move fast and break things,” in tech industry, ML practitioners tend to care little about the size of their products’ impact. In certain cases, they even overlook scientifically rigorous evaluation of their products. These phenomena have been greatly worrying me ever since I started my career in industry. My concern has deepened due to many recent instances of AI applications reproducing human bias on a massive scale and aggravating existing socioeconomic problems.\nRecently, I found out about the event, The Tech Policy Workshop at the Center for Applied Data Ethics at USF via Dr. Rachel Thomas on social media, as I have been enjoying her blog posts and talks. She is smart, honest, and concerned about the welfare of people and society. Thus, I assumed that the workshop would be beneficial in many ways. The lineup was also very interesting because the speakers had diverse backgrounds. Additionally, the low registration cost was helpful.\nI have been interested in fairness, accountability, and transparency of ML for several years, and thus have been attending events related to the topics. Compared with those events, I found this workshop unique in two ways. First, the organizers made a great effort to gather experts from a wide variety of domains ranging from computer science to policymaking. This makes sense because tech ethics and policy are multidisciplinary issues. Second, by choosing the format of a workshop, instead of a conference, the event was more interactive. There were several hands-on exercises, which encouraged valuable discussions among the attendees. The workshop exceeded my expectations and I felt grateful for the opportunity to attend."

    "text": "Interactive ethics exercise on facial recognition\nEvery session was interesting and unique in its own way. However, the main lesson I got out of the workshop came from the ethics session led by Irina Raicu from Santa Clara University. Ethics can be vague, abstract, and even esoteric but Irina made it sound accessible. She compared it to birdwatching; the more we learn about ethics, the more easily we can notice ethical issues in the world. Instead of giving a lengthy philosophy lecture, she taught us various easy-to-understand ethical “lenses”. She then asked us to use these in an exercise based on a real-world case about face recognition. The case was about a dataset1 that ML researchers at IBM created to train a fairer face recognition model.\nI was already familiar with the case. Joy Buolamwini, a ML researcher at MIT, published a study2 that revealed gender and racial bias in the training dataset in many commercial face recognition platforms including IBM’s. After this paper was published, IBM was forthcoming about the issue and they promised to improve their application. It is safe to assume that IBM researchers had good intentions when they published a new training dataset. Unfortunately, we found that this new dataset still had many problems, especially related to data privacy.\nDuring the exercise, we applied different ethical lenses to address which ethical values were pursued or violated. Since we were a group of data scientists, policymakers, and activists, there were a variety of ideas. I admit that in the beginning of the exercise, I was somewhat frustrated because ethics cannot be easily optimized. This meant that we might not be able to reach conclusions easily. However, once we started discussion, I realized that the true value of the exercise was not about finding the right answer quickly, but about evaluating various perspectives especially when multiple ethical values were in conflict. The exercise also taught me that ethical decision making is a highly dynamic process that requires a diverse set of opinions. I started thinking this type of exercise would be beneficial for tech engineers to change the way they think."

After all, ethics focuses on individuals. Typically, socioeconomic problems are solved more effectively through legislation, regulations, and policies. However, several speakers hinted that training engineers to learn about ethical decision making can still be useful."

    "text": "Tech industry has great power and influence on our society\nAs Prof. Elizabeth E. Joh from UC Davis mentioned, tech industry has a significant amount of power these days. According to her, in certain circumstances, police must even drop their investigation so as not to violate the non-disclosure agreement related to the procurement of technological devices they use. She gave an example of police body-cams produced by the company, Axon, who dominates the market. They make almost every decision on how the device works, how and where data is stored and maintained, and so on. This means the management decision in the tech company can have a significant impact on the general public. Guillaume Chaslot from Algo Transparency delivered a similar message using an example from YouTube. It showed how slow and passive YouTube’s response was on content moderation. This is similar to Facebook’s naïve approach that contributed to the dissemination of disinformation over the internet, which created numerous sociopolitical problems all over the world."

Some even affected their companies’ decisions on certain social issues. The news3 about Google recently hiring firm known for anti-union efforts implies that companies now have recognized employee unrest as a threat. ML practitioners who work closely on sensitive datasets can wield even greater power. Kristian Lum from Human Rights Data Analyses Group shared a disturbing example of a ML application used at a government branch. A ML practitioner manipulated the results by hand-selecting model coefficients from multiple versions of a dataset, but this only came to light much later during an audit. Based on my conversations with other data scientists, proper oversight or formalized review of technical work is still missing in many industries. Under these circumstances, the responsibility to provide transparency and accountability falls to individual ML practitioners. Since building a ML application is a complex process, technical debt can aggravate quickly."

I can share a few things I try at work to make a change even though they are small. First, I seek out resources to learn about best practices in ML across the industry and to establish them at work regarding transparency and accountability. My team uses Model Cards4, which summarize how models are trained and how they are supposed to be used, and Datasheets5, which describe how data are collected, used, and processed. Second, to prevent technical debt, I often ask for reviews so that my work is seen by many different stakeholders. Another effort is bringing my work to a public space through publications, seminars, or conferences. For the tech ethics and policy issues, I try to take advantage of any opportunities inside my job (e.g., lunch-and-learn sessions) or outside (e.g., house parties or friends’ gatherings) to raise awareness. Finally, I try to learn more about the topics via events like this workshop."

    "text": "What I can do as a citizen\nI spent a lot of time thinking about what I can do as a tech worker, but I was forgetting something more important. At the end of the workshop, Prof. Elizabeth E. Joh talked about how tech companies wield their massive power in surveillance and policing. An attendee asked her whether there is anything we can do to make a change. Rather than answering his question, she asked him how many times he has previously attended city council meetings of his own city. She said there is still not enough awareness about this problem among the general public nor even momentum to create strong public opinion. That is why we need to raise our voices to address the issue and demand a change. Carrying out my duty as a citizen by speaking up was the one that I have overlooked.\nAt the workshop, I heard from Bay Area government officials about how they try to protect their citizens. Catherine Bracy from TechEquity Collaborative discussed organizations that help protect local communities from tech-related problems. Even though the Bay Area has been facing many problems such as housing and severe income inequality due to tech industry, it also has become the place where movements to fight back are pioneered. I think it has happened here because 1) it is the epicenter of the tech boom, 2) the severity of the problems is extreme, and 3) people are more aware of and sensitive about these issues.\nOther local governments face a very different situation. The Litigating Algorithms report6 by the AI Now Institute mentions that many local governments are drawn to the idea of implementing automated decision processes (ADP) because officials expect ADP to save money. Since the governments do not have affordable access to the right talent, they end up outsourcing the work to cheap vendors who often do poor execution and do not provide enough transparency. The report lists many examples of ADP that went wrong and harmed many people."

Government officials I spoke to at the workshop said it is extremely difficult for governments to catch up with the tech industry. It makes sense—policymaking is an inherently slow process but tech is all about fast developments and adaptations. To reduce the gap, we can start organizing small groups of tech workers to help nonprofits and local governments navigate the ever-changing tech space more efficiently. In the long run, these groups can form an advisory board or a civilian oversight committee to monitor tech-related issues in local communities such as predictive policing. By then, of course, these groups will include not only tech workers but other stakeholders such as local residents, legal experts, social scientists, activists, and more. This way, tech workers like myself can provide our local communities with technical expertise. At the same time, I will have a better idea of the real impact that my work makes. I optimistically believe that as we tech workers engage with our communities, we will change tech culture positively."

I am sure many attendees had the same experience. It’s a rare occasion to have a diverse group of people sharing many concerns about the future in the same place for two days of honest discussions.\nWhen I saw ads for the event, I hesitated whether I should register. I was unsure whether I would belong there because policy is outside of my experience. During the workshop, I confessed this to other attendees. Some said they had similar hesitations. After listening to my confession, Shirley Bekins, a housing activist who sat beside me, said with a big smile, “Of course you should be here!”"

    "section": "Keynote: Health, Technology and Race",
    "text": "Keynote: Health, Technology and Race\nAs a person who’s been attending FAccT every year, I’ve been familiar with the criticism to the FAccT academic community; many studies appeared here are often too abstract or disconnected from the real world and the impacted communities. The organizers are aware of this and they have been making efforts such as organizing CRAFT (Critiquing and Rethinking Accountability, Fairness and Transparency) sessions where they bring more multidisciplinary stakeholders. I considered the first keynote from today, given by Yeshimabeit “Yeshi” Milner, the executive director and co-founder of Data for Black Lives (D4BL), as a signal from the conference saying that they are actively working on this criticism. In this regard, it was an excellent keynote speech to kick off the conference.\nAt the very beginning of the talk, Yeshi said, “we will never achieve fairness, accountability, and transparency without first demanding justice, power, and self-determination.” Again, this directly points out that without a holistic approach where we bring all the stakeholders, achieving justice and making changes isn’t going to happen. Yeshi then talked about racial disparity examples where Black people were discriminated and disproportionately affected in a negative way, especially in healthcare.\nShe introduced the COVID-19 Data Tracker Project where organizers in the D4BL members compiled a dataset by themselves to highlight the stark disparities in health outcomes related to COVID-19. She mentioned that the larger goal here is to “build the political power of Black communities” as well, which is a critical point. She also emphasized that any intervention that does not build political power or agency of the marginalized community is liable to harm rather than to help. Considering that even some tech-for-good projects with good intentions often sideline those who are affected by the system, her remark was poignant.\n“We need to think ‘who do we need to be’” At the end of the talk, she mentioned the importance of reflection, and said we need to resist the urge to feel compelled to keep moving forward, but to pause and reflect on ourselves. This involves identifying what we should unlearn and how we need to create new spaces to bring people who are directly impacted. I think this passionate and moving speech from Yeshi sent out this important message to all attendees, especially to academics and tech workers, like myself."

    "text": "Algorithm Audit and Impact Assessment\nFor tech workers who are interested robust and responsible AI like myself, case studies are like gems. We are always curious about how others do things and want to learn from each other. That’s why I was very happy to see a case study about algorithm audit from Wilson et al., Building and Auditing Fair Algorithms: A Case Study in Candidate Screening.\nResearchers from Northeastern University worked with Pymetrics, a company that uses gamification and AI to assist hiring in other companies. This collaboration itself was a unique instance because most audits happen internally or in a permission-less form where the companies being audited do not cooperate with the auditors. The academic researchers seemed to be quite transparent about the process (e.g., they revealed they were paid but the audit was done independently) and disclosed some problems in Pymetric’s system based on the criteria they used. I don’t know the full details yet but it was nice to hear that Pymetrics started working on solutions to fix these.\nSpeaking of the audit, there was another interesting paper about Amazon’s questionable practice in product recommendation. It’s been known that Amazon created their own private brand and started competing against other brands. The paper, When the Umpire is also a Player: Bias in Private Label Product Recommendations on E-commerce Marketplaces investigates this issue by conducting a systematic audit on Amazon’s recommendation system. They found that Amazon’s private brand has greater exposure in the sponsored ads by comparing related item network (RIN) models between the private brand’s and others’ networks.\nFinally, there was a paper dedicated to algorithmic impact assessment. The authors in the paper, Algorithmic Impact Assessments (AIA) and Accountability: The Co-construction of Impacts, pointed out that often poor impact assessment practices neither mitigate harm nor bring effective algorithm governance. They emphasized that impact assessment should be closely related to accountability, especially for both institutions and people who are affected. The paper showcases impact assessment examples from different domains, which will be useful to design an effective and accountable algorithmic impact assessment procedure."

    "text": "Trust in AI\nSpeaking of impact assessment, if we have incredibly thoughtful (which is probably very detailed) impact assessment and documentation of deployed algorithms, does it bring more trust? The paper, The Sanction of Authority: Promoting Public Trust in AI, says, perhaps not. The authors bring up the example of aviation industry. When we board on a plane, do we want to see the maintenance log, history of pilot performance to reassure ourselves? Or, do we normally trust that aviation is “highly regulated, comparatively safe, and any breach of safety will be sanctioned”? The authors suggest that the latter is how public trust is formed. This is an excellent point. Documentation of deployed AI systems can be as bad as terms of service statements, which usually have extremely poor readability and can be easily manipulated. I liked that the authors emphasized both the importance of regulatory system but also of externally auditable AI documentation, which would facilitate the development of AI regulations."

    "section": "Data Governance",
    "text": "Data Governance\nMy favorite talk of the day was Towards Accountability for Machine Learning Datasets: Practices from Software Engineering and Infrastructure by Hutchinson et al.\nIt’s not too difficult to meet ML practitioners who are obsessed with state-of-the-art deep learning models and conveniently ignore training data and how their data is preprocessed. These people often have a tendency of even looking down upon data preprocessing process and consider it demeaning. This paper takes a jab at this phenomenon.\nThe authors first talk about data scapegoating. Even though everyone is well aware of “garbage in, garbage out” relationship between data and ML models, often data is overlooked and undervalued. Many ML practitioners depend on benchmark datasets, which “reinforce the notion of data as fixed resources.” In my experience, this tendency intensifies the fanaticism on ML algorithms even though they are just a tiny part of a much bigger picture. With many good off-the-shelf models readily available, frankly speaking, models are rather becoming commodities.\nThey also point out the lack of good governance practice in data maintenance. Understanding ML model performance often requires good and detailed understanding of training data. However, validation and verification of training data is rarely conducted in ML engineering pipelines.\nFinally, the authors didn’t forget to mention the power imbalanced between ML practitioners and data providers. I often feel extremely fortunate that I have experienced the entire end-to-end process of an academic research. I started from scratch and designed a process to collect the data by myself, which required great care and intense labor. In the current ML trend, this step is often conveniently removed and thus creates a bad habit of ignoring labor and responsibility in the data collection and development process.\nI really appreciated the simplicity of the authors’ suggestion on this problem; “acknowledge that datasets are technical infrastructures.” Since many ML practitioners are familiar with tech infrastructures such as software programs, the authors suggest that we simply apply existing practices to datasets; create requirements, design, and tests. Once this formally becomes a part of infrastructure, it also becomes easy to get all the existing stakeholders in the pipeline involved."

This year, there were many in- depth theoretical studies where researchers built mathematical models to simulate the propagated effect of bias in machine learning (ML). Empirical studies were also presented as well, in which researchers crowd-sourced data to show bias in human judgment especially when they interact with ML algorithms. Unfortunately, due to the recent long-term government shutdown, there weren’t many government officials who were supposed to participate. Hence, it was lacking to see how the discoveries made in academia can be translated into actual policies and legislation. However, it’s important to notice that there is huge growing interest in this field as ML-based algorithmic decision making is widespread in our society."

    "text": "Tutorials\nFor tutorials, I attended the Translation Tutorial: A History of Quantitative Fairness in Testing and Hands-on Tutorial: AI Fairness 360 Part 1 and Part 2.\nThe tutorials are divided into two categories: translation and hands-on. Since the conference is multi-disciplinary, there are attendees from various backgrounds; computer science, social science, law and policy, etc.\n\nTranslation Tutorial: A History of Quantitative Fairness in Testing\nThe translation tutorials are designed to have everyone more or less be on the same page. This specific translation tutorial I attended seemed to be aimed at computer scientists who are not much aware of the history of research on fairness and automated decision making. This was given by Google researchers Ben Hutchinson and Margaret Mitchell, who showed that the growing current interest on fairness in ML isn’t something new but existed in 1960’s when the civil rights movement started, which made sense.\nThen, the interest was on designing fair standardized tests like SAT or LSAT. Based on correlation studies, researchers then discovered that standardized tests require specific cultural knowledge, which is unfair to racial minorities. There were several views on how to build a fairer model, similar to the various modeling perspectives found in modern studies, such as whether to use sensitive features like race or gender exclusively in models. Also, researchers then pointed out that what we are trying to predict and what we should do are two different questions, which is always mentioned in almost every presentation at this conference.\nBen and Margaret finished the talk by inspiring the audience with various research opportunities that we can learn from the history. For instance, these historical studies started by asking the question of “what is unfair?” instead of the definition of fairness itself. Correlation- based approach and addressing regression problem (instead of classification) in fairness are other examples.\n\n\nHands-on Tutorial: AI Fairness 360\nThe second tutorial I attended (“AI Fairness 360”) was a hands-on one. Here, I learned about IBM Research’s effort to build an open-source Python package that implemented mathematical definition of various fairness criteria and how to apply them to a user’s existing workflow. The package seemed quite comprehensive and had great usability for the following reasons:\n\nThere is no one definition that satisfies all the needs and hence they have implemented a variety of metrics.\nThe package addresses different steps in ML pipeline where the fairness adjustment (i.e., mitigation algorithm) can be made: pre-process (mitigation to training data), in-process (mitigation to model during training), post-process (mitigation to predicted labels). This gives freedom and flexibility in the mitigation process.\nIts syntax is similar to scikit-learn, which make everything easy and familiar. Plus, their API is well-established, and the repository has many notebook examples.\nThe package can have various types of data (tabular, images, etc.)\n\nThis is just a start and of course, there are aspects that can be improved and investigated. First, some mitigation algorithms require tuning. It’ll be interesting to understand how this works on top of the main ML model’s tuning process. Since there are various fairness metrics, it would be nice to directly target those metrics for tuning. When a mitigation algorithm is applied, we sometimes see a compromise in model performance. In this case, it will be interesting to conduct an error analysis to find in which examples the model starts missing predictions."

    "section": "Keynote",
    "text": "Keynote\nThere were two keynotes from two very different domains: computer science and law. The computer science one was given by Jon Kleinberg at Cornell University. His talk was about mathematical formulation of a mitigation policy called Rooney Rule. The Rooney Rule is a requirement that at least one of the finalists be chosen from the affected group. His researched showed that it not only improves the representation of this affected group, but also leads to higher payoffs in absolute terms for the organization performing the recruiting. He presented a mathematical proof to prove his point. His model has only three parameters: composition of pool (diversity), level of bias, and abundance of outliers (superstars) and he showed that with certain constraints, Rooney Rule can be used to improve to the utility of the entire group (not just for the minority).\nThe second one was given by Deirdre Mulligan from UC Berkeley. Her talk was on “fostering cultures of algorithmic responsibility through administrative law and design”. She started by citing the case Loomis v. Wisconsin where Eric Loomis challenged the State of Wisconsin’s use of proprietary, closed-source risk assessment software (COMPAS) in the sentencing of himself to six years in prison. His argument was that there was gender and race bias in the software, which was also addressed by many investigative journalists. One of the interesting and disappointing part of this case was that the court addressed that “it is unclear how COMPAS accounts for gender and race…”, meaning the lack of transparency of the software but also the lack of ability to handle these cases in law. To fix this problem, she emphasized that there should be case laws addressing limits and details of math and algorithms, but more importantly, a “contestable” design. This means whenever there is a wrong done to a person by automated decision, they should be able to contest on this algorithmic decision."

    "title": "Fairness in ML at ACM FAT 2019",
    "section": "Main sessions",
    "text": "Main sessions\nIn total, there were 11 sessions and there was a wide range of topics ranging from problem formulation to content distribution and economic models. The following sessions stood out.\n\nFraming and Abstraction\nThe talks in this session here mentioned that problems in ML projects can start from the very beginning where ML practitioners and data scientists start formulating ideas and framing problems. For examples, if what one wants to measure cannot be obtained or measurable, they use a proxy that is correlated to the original metric they wanted to measure. Sometimes data scientists transform a regression problem as classification by discretizing variables. Unfortunately, these decisions are often not well documented even though they happen in many layers in a ML project.\n\n\nProfiling and Representation\nChakraborty at al. presented an interesting idea of handling online trolls in their talk, “Equality of Voice: Towards Fair Representation in Crowdsourced Top-K Recommendations.” Since algorithms trained by online user data make often offensive and biased prediction, they came up with a fairer “voting” system by considering that there are a few bad actors (the trolls) and that most users are silent (who don’t case a vote). Here, the main challenge was the latter because they need to infer how a silent user might have voted. To solve this, they used existing personalized recommendation techniques.\n\n\nFairness methods\nIn “From Soft Classifiers to Hard Decisions: How fair can we be?”, Canetti at al. tackles the fairness problem by implementing a deferral process. Instead of making hard yes/no decisions, the model can defer the decision to a group of moderators so that they can gather more information and make more socially-acceptable decisions. Their paper discussion a couple of options of deferrals: applying different thresholds per group for deferral or equalizing the accuracy with equal deferral rate.\nSimilarly, in “Deep Weighted Averaging Classifiers”, Card et al. questions when we should know when not to trust a classifier. On top of traditional model performance, they come up with a separate measure of model credibility which can address whether this model is a right tool. They provided a fun example where they build a model by using the MNIST dataset and then used the trained model on the Fashion MNIST (the former has images of numerical digits and the latter, images of clothes and shoes). The model can still make predictions but clearly this model is not built for the testing data. In this case, the model’s “credibility” is very low.\n\n\nExplainability\nUstun at al. points out that explanability does not mean contestability in their talk, “Actionable Recourse in Linear Classification”. When a model explains why your loan is rejected, it doesn’t mean what you should do about it, especially the explanation is based on immutable features like your race. They suggest that we should have a system and model that provides “ability to obtain a desired prediction from a model by changing actionable input” so that the model’s explanation is actually useful. Their tool provides two answers: 1) what users can do to flip the decision and 2) the proof of no recourse (by checking every option in actionable features). The second answer can be still valuable because then it provides the user with contestable information.\n\n\nEconomic Models\nThere were two dedicated sessions just for economic fairness, new to this year’s program compared to the last year’s. One interesting concept discussed in multiple talks was “strategic manipulation.” It is also called “Stackelberg game”, where candidates might try to change their feature to game the system (the model) and the learner anticipates this and adjust the classifier by changing the decision boundary more stringent, which can also result in changes in candidates’ behavior. Milli et al.’s discussed in “The Social Cost of Strategic Classification” that so far the approach to this problem has institutional-centric view. For instance, when the institution, who build the model, wants to come up with a counter-measure to strategic manipulation, they weigh hard-to-change features such as parents’ income or zip code more highly. Then it becomes extremely high-cost for credit-worthy individuals in the wrong zip code area to obtain a loan, meaning the social burden is now on individuals. Their study found that as the game is played, individual social burden increases and returns more unfair outcome."

The theoretical studies provide new insights on how to measure abstract concepts like fairness and bias, transferrable to processes like problem statement that are highly important in ML. The empirical studies help theoretical studies grounded and more realistic.

    "text": "General advice\nFirst, before delving into specific tech-skill tips, let’s talk about more general aspects of tech volunteering.\n\nLocal than national or international\nThe first thing you’ll have to do is to choose a nonprofit. If you’ve been interested in data science for social good, you are already familiar with an organization such as DataKind. I’ve worked with DataKind a couple of times for small projects and normally you go through a detailed application process to become a volunteer. Since it’s a popular international organization, the application process is competitive and it’s possible that you will get rejected, which also happened to me several time.\nFamous organizations are all good but I’d like to suggest you look around and go for local nonprofits. They often lack resources to afford tech workers which means that you can easily work with them and your work will make a bigger impact. I’ve joined Texas Justice Initiative (TJI) through a local nonprofit Open Austin, a Code for America Brigade which advocates for open government and civic technology. I went to their meetup a couple of times and joined their Slack channel, where I met our TJI director, Eva.\n\n\nLong-term than short-term\nDepending on the situation, you may work on one-off type projects or more long-term ones. After working with TJI for over a year, I am learning that I get to work on more diverse and in-depth projects since I’ve been here more than a year. For instance, now that I have better understanding of backend, I am paying more attention to automating many backend processes. Plus, with newly accumulated data, I also get to update data journalism reports and launch new investigation.\n\n\nDo your homework\nIf you’re a first-timer and your nonprofit-of-interest doesn’t have any existing volunteers, you might feel intimidated. Then find an organization that already has tech volunteers. When I was reading about TJI before I joined, I found that there are a dozen tech volunteers already, which gave me a sense of reassurance. Most nonprofits disclose funding sources and board members information on their websites. This will give you a better idea on whether your values and what they represent are aligned.\n\n\nReasonable expectations\nNonprofits can be like any other workplaces; there will be some you enjoy working with and some you don’t, and there will be times when things are going really well or falling apart. Thus, having realistic and healthy expectations is important."

    "text": "1. ML and statistical inference\nNow let’s talk about specific tech-skill opportunities. Let’s start with ML and statistical inference first.\n\nPredictive modeling\nFor my police shooting report, I purposefully did not use any ML models because I am aware of how ML tools can generate unintended harm easily when used prematurely (or at all). Whenever I talk to ML practitioners, they often love to devour any datasets and create predictive models. This is extremely dangerous.\nLet’s assume that for whatever reason, we decided to build a predictive model by using the police shooting data. One can potentially use the severity column (whether a person was killed or injured during an incident) as a target and use the rest of the data as predictor variables. Given that most of our data has demographic and location information, this can easily become a bias-reproducing machine.\nBesides, if these models are deployed in public, it’s possible that the models can be used by bad actors to exploit community members who are already suffering from these tragic incidents. For instance, insurance companies might be able to use a model like this and predict how likely people of certain demographics are more likely to be killed by police. Then they can increase health insurance premium for these people.\nBefore even starting a project, I strongly recommend considering and evaluating the risk and ethical concerns first. If the risk is too high, then you shouldn’t build a model. Note that this thoughtful examination requires a diverse set of opinions. Thus, please open the discussion to other members in the organization (and even further) and try to thoroughly examine the risk.\n\n\nOn significance testing\nSome data scientists like computing p-values from their analyses but first and foremost, p-values have many issues (see the official statement from American Statistical Association cautioning the use of p-values). Plus, given that they are usually not the domain experts, it is likely that the hypotheses are not well thought out. Moreover, once you make value statements based on thresholding by using p-values, it is very likely that you will contribute to propagation of misinformation because these statements (e.g., “A is significantly different from baseline”) can be easily cherry-picked and propagated.\n\n\nThen what can I do?\nI am not telling you to drop any statistical inference or ML completely. Rather, I am asking you to recognize the responsibility that comes with using ML techniques. In fact, there are many research papers that use ML in clever ways. For instance, in Gonen and Goldberg’s 2019 paper, Lipstick on a Pig: Debiasing Methods Cover up Systematic Gender Biases in Word Embeddings But do not Remove Them, the authors used predictive modeling to show that (gender) de-biased word embeddings still contain information about gender, which proves that the de-biasing technique doesn’t work. In short, we need to be more thoughtful and creative when it comes to ML."

Data governance is a practice of documenting what the data contains and how it should be used. It’s a great opportunity to learn about data and help the nonprofit utilize the datasets responsibly.\nThere is an excellent paper, Datasheets for Datasets (Gebru et al., 2018) that can guide you through this process. The paper has an exhaustive list of questions that you can answer to understand a dataset and its potential problems and impact. At TJI, I’ve gone through this process and published a Datasheet on TJI’s custodial death dataset focusing on the dataset’s composition. This was a great exercise for all of us because we were able to discuss some potential caveats such as sampling bias of our dataset. Another template you can follow is Data Protection Impact Assessment from European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This also asks you to answer questions to understand the impact and ethical concerns that come with the data.\nFinally, once you’ve created data governance documentation, make sure you provide it to users when they consume the dataset so that they are also aware of the information. This creates a chain of responsibility."

Personally, I prefer data journalism reports with static images because I can control what audience can see and I can minimize the chance of them misunderstanding the data.\n\n\nFind a reference point\nProviding a context is extremely important. If I don’t know where something stands compared with others, how would I know whether it is better or worse? Luckily, this comparison can be easily done by comparing your data with other reference datasets. In Part 1, I’ve used the US census data and public health data for this. You can see this approach all the time in data journalism reports from major news organizations such as New York Times. Comparing your data with a reference data helps you ask more interesting questions to understand the difference.\n\n\nGet a domain expert review\nIt’s likely that tech workers are not the domain experts. In this case, make sure your work is seen by them before you publish. You can start by sharing your work with other members in the nonprofit. You can also reach out to academics who are most likely very interested in this type of work. For my report, Eva helped me reach out to Howard Henderson of Texas Southern University’s Barbara Jordan-Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs and Center for Justice Research, and Kevin Buckler of University of Houston-Downtown’s Department of Criminal Justice for a review.\n\n\nLeave out any questionable information\nYou might want to use everything that’s in a dataset to write a report. This is not necessarily the best idea, unfortunately. In our police shooting dataset, there is a column called deadly_weapon which shows whether the person shot by police possessed a deadly weapon. It turns out that this information is highly contentious because whether an object is perceived as deadly varies widely. Based on studies and news reports, a BB gun, a butter knife, or a candlestick can be perceived as a deadly weapon. After deliberation, we’ve decided not to use this information because we thought this categorization misrepresents true information. We plan to revisit this after collecting information about actual objects used in the incidents.\n\n\nResearch opportunities\nDatasets gathered by local nonprofits are so specific and unique that they provide interesting research opportunities, which becomes great material for a data journalism report. Currently at TJI, several volunteers and I have been working on identifying systematic pattern in interaction between officers and civilians in police shooting incidents. Jiletta Kubena, a criminologist and a TJI volunteer, has been studying survey results on various populations, such as people in custody, of those who’ve been impacted by COVID-19.\n\n\nTech setup\nYou will be creating same types of plots over and over with small changes depending on how your investigation goes. Thus, it’s better to spend time in the beginning to create modules for plotting. At the same time, ask if your nonprofit already has a specific visual style guide that you can follow. This helps visual consistency."

    "text": "4. Sustainable workflow\nWhat kind of tech tools and workflow gets to be implemented in a nonprofit heavily depends on their volunteers. However, the volunteer-dependent workflow is quite fragile because volunteers in general have weaker commitment because they are not always readily available. Thus, it’s quite important to help a nonprofit build a sustainable workflow.\nImplementing CI/CD flow is a must and you can even reuse your notebooks to create analytics reports with updated data by using a package such as Papermill. If you have a heterogenous dataset, you can utilize scikit-learn’s ColumnTransformer to build a consistent and robust data preprocessing pipeline. Finally, you can also set up a data validation check by using a tool like Pandera. This will help you monitor and flag any unexpected data drift.\nA sustainable workflow is also more than just the tech side. Recently, at TJI, we’ve implemented a formal review process to improve the quality of our work. We used to review manuscripts on Google Docs but now we review them on GitHub as a pull request. Nick Holden, a software engineer and a TJI volunteer, connected our content management system (CMS) to this process so that people who are not familiar with GitHub can easily create a manuscript. Writing a plain text document on the CMS automatically creates a pull request and other members at TJI can review and exchange feedback transparently."

    "text": "5. Community building\nAs a volunteer, you can always work by yourself on a one-off project. Even if that’s the case, having a sense of community makes your work more enjoyable and prevents fast volunteer turnover. In this sense, community building is quite important.\nCommunity building can be socializing but it’s also about building robust infrastructure because it reduces unnecessary stress. Given that volunteer-dependent workflow is fragile, and robustness, accountability, and transparency matter even more. As a tech worker, you can help nonprofits adopt good practices from tech workflow such as automation, code review, software engineering practices, and so on. But when bringing a new tech tool, please try to use open source software as much as possible. I’ve seen a case where a tech worker brought their company’s product and left, which made the nonprofit’s entire backend hugely dependent on a niche commercial product. Sometimes nonprofits are approached by private partners. With your corporate experience, you can help the nonprofit protect their asset too.\nImplementing a good practice for collaboration is equally important. You can start by encouraging other volunteers to showcase and highlight their work. I’ve suggested a dedicated blog where all volunteers can write about their work in their own words. This accelerates knowledge transfer within the organization and helps other nonprofits too.\nFinally, I want to emphasize that you should watch out for volunteer burnout. It happened to me multiple times unfortunately. I got super excited and passionate about a subject matter and I ended up with exhausting all my energy in a short period of time. So please pace yourself and take breaks if needed. But when you do so, instead of ghosting please tell others so that they have reasonable expectations while you’re gone."

It’s been amazing to have opportunities to work with different types of data that I don’t get to see at work. I’ve also got to work on various projects from exercising data assessment practice and writing data journalism reports, to creating custom data visualization modules and transferring ML Ops practices to the existing workflow. I’m looking forward to exploring research opportunities with causal modeling and explainable AI with our dataset in the future.\nBut more importantly, I’ve been lucky to work with our director Eva and all the volunteers who have been kind, cordial, and open to new ideas. It was also fantastic to work with people from different disciplines and to learn from these domain experts. This helped me expand my network and meet other nonprofit organizers, academics, and tech workers. Finally, I’ve learned a lot about local social issues surrounding my neighborhood and my city, which have significant impact on our community members. I am looking forward to many other interesting opportunities in TJI.\nI hope these tips help you start exploring volunteering opportunities. Finally, you are more helpful than you think! So don’t worry about whether you have the right skill sets or not. They will appreciate your knowledge and there will be many things you can contribute to. So if you find any interesting organizations, don’t be afraid to reach out. You will help other people and learn a lot in the process. Good luck!"

    "text": "This book by Cathy O’Neil is always a nice introduction to learning about algorithmic harms. I sometimes gift the book to friends and colleagues who just start their career in the field. The first two chapters of the book is especially enough to understand the general idea.\nI was most interested in the D.C.’s Teacher Evaluation System, IMPACT and its problems. The system uses student performance score to assess teacher performance. This extremely simple assumption itself seems to be highly problematic, in my opinion. My assumption is that the city considered that this would be one of the easiest solutions to act on (i.e., hiring and firing of teachers). After the system is implemented, highly praised teachers sometimes get fired and for them it was really difficult to understand why the decision was made. It also turned out that teachers sometimes cheat and correct students’ scores.\nAt the end of the first chapter, the author summarized a pattern of algorithimc harms in three ways. First, the models are usually opaque, which reduce accountability and make them inscrutable. Second, often these models can harm the people who are targeted because training data’s bias is simply reproduced. Third, these models are easily scalable and thus generate harms in a much larger scale.\n\n\n\nThis cast study is about an algorithmic transparency bill introduced by a New York City Council, James Vacca back in 2017. The original version of the bill would require city agencies “that use algorithms or other automated processing methods that target services, impose penalties, or police persons to publish the source code used for such processing.” Given that this is still something very difficult to practice in 2023, I find this proposal quite radical and refreshing. His motivation made sense though: complete transparency on any public automated decision-making.\nUnfortunately the bill has met many criticisms such as privacy concerns, exposure of proprietary information, and effectiveness in public understanding of the source code. The bill was modified several times and the final watered-down version was to create a task force that is comprised of experts in diverse fields that would examine algorithmic decision-making (ADS) tools that the city uses, and make recommendations. The catch though was that various city departments who use these tools are not required to participate in the collaboration with the task force, meaning the participation was voluntary. Also the fact that the task force would simply make recommendations means there is zero enforceability.\nI did some digging because I got curious about what happened to the task force. Their website (New York City Automated Decision Systems Task Force) shows the members of the task force, which actually have active members/researchers in the field of AI ethics. They published a report back in 2019 and at a glance, they do make concrete recommendations on each type of algorithmic decision-making systems in NYC. In Nov 2019, the city seemed to decide to establish an Algorithms Management and Policy Officer (AMPO). But some news articles say this position doesn’t exist any more. Regardless, AMPO did release a report in 2020, which has “algorithmic tool directory” that shows how the city’s ADS tools work, which I find pretty useful. Here’s an example:\n\n\n\nNYC Algorithmic Management and Policy Officer, Summary of Agency Compliance Reporting. Algorithmic Tool Directory example: Department of Correction\n\n\n\n\n\nThis short 2016 guide was written by Jon Kleinberg, Jens Ludwig, and Sendhil Mullainathan. I’ve been to Kleinberg’s talks several times at FAccT and so I was aware of his previous work.\nThis guide stood out compared to other reading assignments this week because there was mention of the “enthusiasm” about solving social problems with machine learning (ML). If we can implement a ML system to solve these issues, we can provide greater transparency and potentially better and more desirable outcome especially because sometimes human decision-making process is opaque. This guide was also more technical than other reading materials. The authors mention the following tips:\n\n\nThe authors emphasize that many social-sector decisions do not require a prediction and the practitioners should be careful when formulating the problem. This is mostly related to assessing the predictive algorithm’s social impact.\n\n“just because something is predictable, that doesn’t mean we are comfortable having our decision depend on that prediction.”\n\n\n\n\nSince ML is rooted in statistics, there are cases where one has to deal with higher level of uncertainty in a system. This alone makes the system less reliable and more challenging to work with, but if the risk is also high, it is better to reconsider whether ML is well-suited here. The authors also mention that ML is often good at optimizing a defined metric only at the expense of everything else.\n\n\n\nIn this section, the author mentions racial bias in criminal justice system and how the bias can be easily replicated in ML when the training data simply consist of historic incidents. Another important thing they mentioned was that ML is not good for measuring hard-to-define combination of outcomes such as sentencing where society’s sense of retribution, mercy, and redemption should be factored in (and they are all hard to measure).\n\n\n\nThis section was about evaluating the model with the right validation data. They specifically talk about cases where there are inherent sampling bias in collecting labeled data. For instance, in a ML-based filter system, you end up collecting positively-labeled cases because the negative predictions never come through. They also warn about scalability:\n\n“It can be misguided, and sometimes outright harmful, to adopt and scale up new predictive tools when they’ve only been evaluated on cases from historical data with labels, rather than evaluated based on their effect on the key policy decision of interest.”\n\n\n\n\nThis part was more about how to build a human-in-the-loop system and how human decision-makers can coexist with ADS, which is an active area of human-centered AI (HAI). An example would be how judges use the model prediction from risk assessment tools in decision-making.\n\n\n\n\nThis primer was written by Data & Society, an independent nonprofit research organization about tech ethics and governance. This was an excellent overview of ADS and algorithmic accountability.\nIt gives a summary of ProPublica’s COMPAS investigation. It says the two issues of this incident are 1) lack of standard definition of algorithmic bias (related to the debate between Northpointe and Propublica’s conflicting opinions about what is fair) and 2) lack of mechanism for algorithmic accountability (wasn’t mentioned here but probably related to Loomis v. Wisconsin).\nThen it lists several key issues related to ADS. Regarding fairness and bias, it pointed out that algorithms can be quickly outdated unless they are consistently monitored and adjusted. About opacity and transparency, it mentioned that transparency can be exploited by bad actors gaming the system. Importantly, it mentioned the repurposing of algorithms and data meaning algorithms built for a problem can be repurposed and applied to a completely different problem (PredPol using an algorithm built for earthquake modeling). Finally it mentioned the lack of standards for auditing.\nRegarding algorithmic accountability, which the primer defines as “the assignment of responsibility for how an algorithm is created ans its impact on society”, the lack of this makes me think the moral disengagement paper we read last week. In terms of the enforcement and regulation, it did mention a possibility of self-regulation by corporations but as I expected (and agreed), it said this approach is often ad hoc and out of control of citizens and governments, which is unreliable."

    "text": "The lecture and talk with Rumman Chowdhury\nThis week’s lecture was led by Professor Mehran Sahami, who talked about algorithmic decision-making, different definitions of fairness, and their relationship to the COMPAS incident. Among many definitions of fairness, we covered anti-classification, classification parity, calibration, and lack of disparate impact. The first three are mathematically well-defined and the last one focuses on empirical evidence. Regarding the COMPAS case, he mentioned that Northpointe’s argument was that their model is fair because from the perspective of the calibration definition of fairness, their model had similar predictive probability between white and black based on their risk factors. But as our guest speaker for the week, Rumman Chowdhury pointed out, Nortpointe’s survey questions included irrelevant and bias-reproducing questions such as whether a person grew up in a poor neighborhood or knew people who went to jail, etc.\nDuring Rumman Chowdhury’s session, she mentioned several interesting points. First, she summarized the problem of ADS as “models are good at generalization but bad at specificity.” Second, regarding her experience in Twitter, she mentioned that working on a product team by implementing research ideas was very helpful to produce power and momentum. Regarding generative AI, she mentioned that the error space by AI is now much wider than before, which creates bigger concerns, and where often the key question is “who gets to be the arbitor of the truth?” Regarding algorithmic auditing, on one hand she promoted red-teaming (especially as a community-driven approach), but also at the same time she said it’s important to have community consensus on auditing."

We had to cover 4 definitions of fairness and COMPAS case study within 15 minutes. I was already quite familiar with everything but I wonder how many attendees were able to process all of it in that short amount of time.\nDuring the breakout session, instead of talking about fairness, ADS, and algorithmic accountability, we were asked to think about when we were denied to talk about tech ethics at work or work-adjacent settings, and why we thought that was the case. Then we did an exercise where we listed various values we care about and see whether any values are diametrical.\nTo begin with, the breakout session (group discussion) was short, but I was quite unhappy that the discussion was not much related to the topics or the readings. Yes, when building an ADS system, one needs to think about how to handle the trade-offs between different values but especially since this course was advertised as “for practitioners,” I was looking for something more concrete. The post-it exercise was in a way useful but I also thought it prevented us from having an actual conversational discussion.\nOverall, this week has been a review of the stuff that I was mostly familiar with (thank you FAccT conferences!). I hope there are more active and practical engagements in the coming weeks."

    "text": "Conference Overview\nThe conference is held virtually this year for the obvious reason. It’s on a platform called circle.so. Everything happens in one platform; video streaming, general announcement, community boards, internal messaging, etc., which is pretty convenient.\nAs an international virtual conference, the schedule is a bit brutal. For my time zone (UTC-6), the schedule starts at 6 am and lasts until 4-7 pm in the evening. Talks in the main session are pre-recorded and thus attendees can watch at their convenience but some sessions occur in real time. Luckily, the conference organizers set up dedicated watching times for the main session, which I really appreciate.\nToday was about tutorials. I attended the following: - Causal Fairness Analysis - Explainable ML in the Wild: When Not to Trust Your Explanations - Responsible AI in Industry: Lessons Learned in Practice - A Behavioral and Economic Approach to Algorithmic Fairness & Human-Centered Mechanism Design - How to Achieve Both Transparency and Accuracy in Predictive Decision Making: an Introduction to Strategic Prediction\nEach tutorial was about 90 minutes, which was a bit short for me. Since FATE (fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics) topics are highly diverse, it makes sense to have many different tutorials. But because they were so short, they weren’t much of a deep-dive and an overview (at least for the ones I attended)."

The speaker (Elias Bareinboim) started the talk by mentioning that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff in discrimination lawsuit, meaning they have to prove the causal connection if they were treated unfairly. I found this emphasis and motivation from legal lense quite refreshing.\nThe material was relatively easy to follow in the beginning where Elias explained SCM models and how we evaluate them with given empirical data. However, it got a bit challenging to follow where we started combining fairness and causal models, especially given that fairness metrics are so diverse.\nFor me the most interesting part was where Elias compared various counterfactual scenarios. I’ve always assumed that the causal DAGs will not change when we switch the group membership to simulate counterfactuals, but obviously there is no guarantee. It’s possible that we can have indirect and spurious effects for counterfactual scenarios and he explained that we need to subtract those effects from direct effects."

    "text": "Explainable ML in the Wild: When Not to Trust Your Explanations\nThis tutorial consisted of three parts: overview of explainable AI (XAI) methods, their limitations and ethical/practical challenges. I found the second part most interesting.\nThe speaker (Chirag Agarwal) introduced four aspects of XAI limitations: faithfulness, stability, fragility, and evaluation gap. Faithfulness refers to whether explanations change when models changes (and perhaps also the Rashomon effect). Stability refers to whether post-hoc explanations are unstable with respect to small non-adversarial input perturbation. For instance, some evidence shows that LIME explanations may change if we change random seed in certain ML algorithms. We also wouldn’t want our models to chance explanations based on hyperparameters.\nFragility is about whether explanation changes according to data drift in input space. This is closely related to adversarial attack on explanations (i.e., whether small perturbation can change explanation without changing prediction). Finally, in general, it is very difficult to properly evaluate XAI methods and currently there is no ground truth for evaluation.\nPerhaps because of these problematic features, the case studies presented in the following session felt very nuanced and complicated. As I’ve seen in other responsible AI talks, XAI methods are closely related to human-in-the-loop systems and the level of trust in human end users."

These tools are useful for model monitoring/inspection, generating explanations, fairness mitigation, error analysis, and counterfactual analysis. I was surprised that there are already several open-source tools available such as InterepretML, Fairlearn, What-If Tool.\nThe live demo from Microsoft was impressive but it was too fast to follow (I personally think Jupyter notebook isn’t the best method for presentation if we have to go back and forth a lot). Also I was not sure whether the examples were from deployed projects or toy datasets especially since the speaker talked about fairness mitigation and I was curious about how the full cycle of mitigation process looked like.\nThe case study from LinkedIn at the end was interesting (especially since they presented similar material last year at the same conference) but it felt somewhat disconnected for the same reason I just mentioned above; I wasn’t sure how human end users were involved in the fairness mitigation process."

    "text": "A Behavioral and Economic Approach to Algorithmic Fairness\nThis talk was about looking at the fairness problem from economic perspective. Different from the traditional computer science approach, this talk suggested that economic approach presents the fairness problem in the form social welfare functions where social planner can optimize efficiency (expected outcome of interest among groups) and equity.\nWhat was interesting was that the optimal algorithm isn’t just about prediction function but also about admission rule, meaning how social planner can use the predictions to make decisions. Normally, these admission rules are threshold-based; we make a decision on certain group of individuals based on certain thresholds, which is affected by equity preference of social planner. Another interesting aspect was that this equity preference can even affect the prediction function because decision makers who prefer discrimination may want to use additional features from data to discriminate protected groups."

    "text": "How to Achieve Both Transparency and Accuracy in Predictive Decision Making: an Introduction to Strategic Prediction\nThe whole idea of strategic prediction is very interesting because it’s about human users trying to game the system if they start understanding the rule of the game. For instance, if students learn about the criteria universities use for their admission process, they will try to find ways to cross that threshold so that they can be admitted. This tutorial gave an overview of this phenomenon from the perspective each stakeholder group in the process; institution (algorithm designers), individual (data provider), and society (all people as a whole).\nInstead of doing a deep dive on a specific topic, the tutorial presented various topics in the domain. Recourse and incentivization was one of them. If the deployed algorithm uses a feature that can harm individuals because the feature incentivizes them to behave in a certain way, automated harm at a massive scale will be expected. Another way to look at the strategic prediction is through causality. If we find a true causal relationship between features and model predictions, it might be able to utilize the benefit of strategic prediction from the institution’s perspective and to encourage improvement without encouraging gaming, which will be crucial for modellers."

    "text": "At its core, benchmarking serves as a systematic methodology for objectively evaluating techniques or products through carefully curated test samples. In ML, this practice has traditionally been used in academic research, enabling rigorous comparison of various deep learning models. However, its utility extends beyond research, and it becomes an invaluable tool in production environments, similar to A/B testing for new feature evaluation. Here, we can construct benchmark datasets from historical data, tailoring the evaluation process to our own needs in real-world scenarios.\nIn this post, I am focusing on ML model benchmarking, which primarily evaluates model performance and its robustness, and other factors such as training cost and inference latency. While the landscape of ML benchmarking is dominated by image and text datasets designed for deep learning research, I would like to focus on a less traversed yet equally critical domain: tabular benchmark datasets in production environments. We’ll examine the practical considerations that arise when applying benchmarking to real-world applications."

    "title": "Efficient bug discovery with ML for hardware verification",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Imagine designing a highly complex machine. In order to be certain that it functions as its design specifies and does not have any bugs, you would need to test every aspect of the design exhaustively. If the machine is controlled by a set of knobs that can be turned on and off, this verification process can get exponentially complex. For instance, with a machine that has 100 binary on-off knobs, then 2100 tests need to be run to cover all possible combinations. If we assume that a single test takes one second to run, this equates to 1022 years of testing. For present-day microprocessors, it is even more challenging. There can be thousands or tens of thousands of two-state flip-flops in a single microprocessor. Therefore, it is impossible to verify microprocessor designs exhaustively.\nTo work around this problem, hardware verification engineers use a method called random-constraint testing. This is more sophisticated than simple random adjustment of knobs – it is a hybrid approach of manual control and randomization. Engineers can direct the test behavior to a degree by setting constraints for the tests using adjustable knobs. Once constraints are set, the rest of the verification process depends on randomization; the knobs start subsequent processes that are stochastic, which stimulates various parts of the design. This way, engineers can explore the design randomly under the constraints they have set.\nThis method works well when engineers have not explored the design much. As engineers start exploring a design, they find and fix bugs, and the more they explore, the fewer bugs are left to be fixed. Eventually, it becomes very difficult to detect these rare bugs by random probing. Most of the hardware verification effort goes into finding the few remaining bugs in the design. In fact, this process is so time-consuming that 60-70% of the compute time spent on hardware development goes into verification.\nIf the random-constraint testing is not good at specifically targeting bugs in the design, what are the alternatives? My team in Arm Research has been working on this problem since last year. We have analyzed our CPU verification data and successfully trained machine learning (ML) models to solve this problem. We deployed an ML application with these models in collaboration with production engineers at Arm, Mark Koob and Swati Ramachandran. Our application uses ML to flag tests that are likely to find bugs. Verification engineers can feed a large group of prospective tests to our application, and then the application returns a subset of them that are likely to find bugs. This way, engineers can focus on these tests only, and reduce the number of tests to run, which eventually saves compute costs.\nCurrently, our application is being used consistently by Arm verification engineers as a complementary tool to their existing workflow. On average, it has been shown to be 25% more efficient than the default verification workflow in terms of finding bugs, and 1.33x more efficient at finding unique bugs. Through our application, engineers were able to find more unique bugs per test run when compared to their existing verification workflow."

    "text": "Filtering prospective tests using ML\n\nNow let us take a deeper look at how our application works. The main challenge of using ML for hardware verification is that everything revolves around random-constraint testing. Not only is the data collected by this method, but also the testing infrastructure is built to optimize this process. The problem is that random-constraint testing consists of two very different parts:\n\nDeterministic knob-control by verification engineers, and;\nNon-deterministic subsequent processes that are random and intractable.\n\nThis means two things. Firstly, the only source of the usable data is the knobs. Secondly, we cannot guide tests directly to explore new design space because the whole process is non-deterministic.\nLet’s first look at the knob data. Here, each sample is a test that was run in the past. It has several hundred knob values (input) and a binary output; bug or bug-free. In our data, bugs were extremely rare (less than 1%). To address this severe class imbalance, we adopt two approaches. Firstly, we train a supervised learning model that computes a probability of having a bug based on a set of knob values. This model detects tests that may expose bugs similar to the previous ones. Secondly, we train an unsupervised learning model that estimates similarity between a new test and the previous tests. If the similarity is low, the test is likely to be novel. Novel knob combinations can probe unexplored design areas and are more likely to expose bugs. In our preliminary results, we found that these models can detect different types of bugs. Since our main goal is to capture as many bugs as possible, we flag a test as a bug provided one of the two models predicts it will be.\nTo avoid the difficulty in guiding test behavior, we choose a filtering approach. We leave the knob values to be generated randomly from the testing infrastructure and filter them afterwards based on ML prediction scores. To do so, we need to provide the ML models with a large group of knob values (test candidates) first. Luckily, this process is computationally cheap. Then, the ML models compute prediction scores (the probability of having a bug) of the candidates. Based on the scores, we select a subset of the candidates that are more likely to find bugs than others."

    "section": "Deploying ML within existing random-constraint testing infrastructure",
    "text": "Deploying ML within existing random-constraint testing infrastructure\nNow that we have trained ML models ready, can we completely replace our existing random-constraint testing flow with our application? The answer is no. The filtering approach, even with the unsupervised learning model, does not completely solve the exploration problem. That is why the existing flow (random-constraint testing) should remain. The random probing can still be useful for exploration to a degree, and can provide new training data for model update. Thus, we propose two parallel pathways; one with the default randomized testing and the other with ML models, where an additional set of test candidates are provided and then only the tests flagged by the models are filtered and run. This way, it is possible to continue collecting novel data from the default flow for exploration while exploiting the data from previous tests via the ML application.\nSome may think that our job is done when the models are delivered, and deployment finally happens. This is not true. For the models, a new journey begins when they are deployed in the production environment, because it is likely that unexpected events are waiting for them. For instance, we have learned that design and testing infrastructure go through daily changes, so test behavior and data generation process may change frequently. This means the models deployed in the beginning do not guarantee good performance as time goes by.\nTo address this, we have conducted research into the optimization of model retraining. We identified how often models need to be retrained and how much data should be used for training. Using this information, we’ve built a retraining module that is automatically invoked periodically or upon verification engineers’ request. During the retraining process, we compare a variety of different models and tune their hyperparameters. This allows for flexibility across changes in data generation processes and various microprocessor designs."

    "text": "Towards end-to-end ML\nWhen we talk about ML, the focus is often on algorithms. As I mentioned, however, when it comes to building ML products, the algorithms are only a small part of a much larger pipeline. Especially with scalable deployment in consideration. Starting from data acquisition all the way to deployment and assessment, every step requires attention of data scientists and ML researchers. It is because developing ML products is different from typical software development. A lot of processes are interconnected and data-dependent, which makes them more challenging to test and evaluate.\nAdmittedly, we initially approached the development of this ML application as a “throw it over the wall” type of engagement. After developing the core ML modules (data preprocessing and models), we delivered them to production engineers without much engagement afterwards. After the application was deployed in several projects, we occasionally needed to intervene to deal with unexpected model behavior. We soon realized that not engaging in the deployment process makes it very difficult to solve any issues that happen after model deployment.\nRecently, in collaboration with our colleagues, it has been made easier to make direct contributions to packages. They have developed a Python package for data science and ML, which has become a core part of our ML application. This allowed us to directly contribute to the ML application easily, and also enabled scalable Python in Arm’s internal compute platform. Our new team member, Kathrine (Kate) Behrman has already built a new module to fix an existing problem in model validation. With this momentum, we are more engaged in deployment to make our ML application perform better and more reliable, while exploring new research ideas.\nThrough this process, we learned that getting more involved in ML product development provides many benefits to researchers. First, it makes tech transfer much easier because making direct contributions to deployed products is more frictionless. This also means that we can test our new research ideas easily and measure the effect quickly. In addition, it helps us fix problems efficiently because we have better understanding of how the models are served in deployment. ML products benefit from an evolutionary approach because there is no absolute guarantee that the data or surrounding infrastructure stays the same. Finally, this process naturally brings automation and scalability, which makes our work easily applicable and more impactful."

Besides, the UI also didn’t log cv_results.\n\n\nIs the only logged run the best run?\nHere was where the behavior of mlflow.sklearn.autolog changed. It was supposed to return a single parent run and multiple child runs but when dask-ml was used as tuner, it only logged a single run. I didn’t know whether thi was the best run or not, so I decided to compare the MLflow logged result with the actual search result.\n\nmlflow_run = mlflow_client.get_run(run.info.run_id)\n\n\nassert str(search_cv.best_estimator_.get_params()['clf__learning_rate']) == \\\nmlflow_run.data.params['clf__learning_rate']\nassert str(search_cv.best_estimator_.get_params()['clf__subsample']) == \\\nmlflow_run.data.params['clf__subsample']\n\nLuckily, the assertions have passed, meaning that the single recorded run by MLflow was the best run. Except that users can’t see the child runs in the UI, this behavior seems acceptable.\n\n\n\nTest 3. lightgbm+sklearn autolog and sklearn tuner\nThis test idea came to my mind becasue I imagined it would be very convenient if one could use autologging on top of a sklearn tuner. Thus, I decided to turn on lightgbm autologging in addition to the sklearn autologging.\n\nmlflow.lightgbm.autolog()\n\n\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name='test_3') as run:\n    \n    search_cv = RandomizedSearchCV(pipe, param_space, cv=ps, n_iter=n_search)\n    search_cv.fit(\n        X_train_val,\n        y_train_val,\n        clf__eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)],\n        clf__eval_names=[\"val\"],\n        clf__eval_metric=[\"binary_logloss\"],\n    )\n\n[1] val's binary_logloss: 0.64539\n[2] val's binary_logloss: 0.603905\n[3] val's binary_logloss: 0.566663\n[4] val's binary_logloss: 0.533792\n[5] val's binary_logloss: 0.504106\n[6] val's binary_logloss: 0.476199\n[7] val's binary_logloss: 0.452345\n[8] val's binary_logloss: 0.430183\n[9] val's binary_logloss: 0.409486\n[10]    val's binary_logloss: 0.388993\n[1] val's binary_logloss: 0.6207\n[2] val's binary_logloss: 0.561648\n[3] val's binary_logloss: 0.51229\n[4] val's binary_logloss: 0.470843\n[5] val's binary_logloss: 0.43163\n[6] val's binary_logloss: 0.399279\n[7] val's binary_logloss: 0.371128\n[8] val's binary_logloss: 0.345312\n[9] val's binary_logloss: 0.323905\n[10]    val's binary_logloss: 0.303382\n[1] val's binary_logloss: 0.632926\n[2] val's binary_logloss: 0.582412\n[3] val's binary_logloss: 0.538314\n[4] val's binary_logloss: 0.500565\n[5] val's binary_logloss: 0.467006\n[6] val's binary_logloss: 0.436234\n[7] val's binary_logloss: 0.410759\n[8] val's binary_logloss: 0.384813\n[9] val's binary_logloss: 0.361938\n[10]    val's binary_logloss: 0.342656\n[1] val's binary_logloss: 0.642694\n[2] val's binary_logloss: 0.599408\n[3] val's binary_logloss: 0.5599\n[4] val's binary_logloss: 0.525228\n[5] val's binary_logloss: 0.490788\n[6] val's binary_logloss: 0.461964\n[7] val's binary_logloss: 0.433798\n[8] val's binary_logloss: 0.409936\n[9] val's binary_logloss: 0.385757\n[10]    val's binary_logloss: 0.365051\n\n\nThis time, I found that sklearn autologging behaved normally but lightgbm autologging didn’t work at all.

They have also added the CRAFT session, inspired by the NeurIPS 2018 Workshop, “Critiquing and Correcting Trends in Machine Learning” (CRACT). The session focused on critiques of the field of FAccT, such as its blind spots, omissions, or alternative possibilities that take a more holistic approach.

    "title": "Critiquing and rethinking at ACM FAT 2020",
    "section": "Tutorials",
    "text": "Tutorials\nThis year, the tutorials are divided into four categories (hands-on, translation, implications, and invited). The hands-on tutorials included explanatory tools (Google’s What-If and IBM’s “AI Explainability 360”) and University of Colorado’s fairness-aware recommendation package called librec-auto. These are useful tools, but I assumed I could learn about these tools on my own from their websites. Instead, I attended translation and implications tutorials where the former includes topics on ethics, law and policy, and the latter is about case studies of FAccT topics in industry. Interestingly, some of the translation tutorials focused on positionality, the social and political context that influences, and potentially biases, a person’s unique but partial understanding of the world. Here is the summary of the tutorials I attended.\n\nExplainable AI in Industry: Practical Challenges and Lessons Learned\nThis tutorial discussed several techniques on how to provide explainability in ML models and introduced several case studies. Generally, there are two approaches to achieve explainable AI. We can build an interpretable model such as linear models or decision trees, or we consider coming up with post-hoc explanation for a given model. We focused on the latter. The post-hoc explanation approach can be rephrased as the “attribution” problem. In other words, we want to know why a model makes a certain prediction and attribute the model decision to the feature of an input. The main technique we discussed, integrated gradients1 address this aspect by interpreting explainability as feature gradient. For instance, if I changed a feature X, and then the target Y has changed, we may consider the change of X as an explanation to change of Y. Integrated gradients are model-agnostic interpretation of this idea. Here, we look for feature regions where model performance changes dramatically (i.e., large gradient) and integrate them to create an explanation. One application example was diabetic retinopathy to predict severity of the disorder in retinal images. The method was able to provide explanation to deep learning model prediction by locating retinal legions. Although this is useful for its model-agnostic approach, it still lacks global explanation.\n\n\nLeap of FATE: Human Rights as a Complementary Framework for AI Policy and Practice\nEven though AI governance has emerged as a hot topic, many are disappointed by the current ethical framework for AI-related problems. The speakers suggest that we can use human-rights based approach to bring more rigorous and specific groundwork for AI governance. Existing treaties or resolutions such as Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UHDR) or International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) are good examples. Adopting a human rights perspective for AI governance provides several benefits. First, these are well-established universal standards that have been existing for many decades. Second, they have more currency than ethics, and thus provide better accountability especially when these are violated (i.e., violation to human rights). Since these resolutions are much more specific than ethics, it is possible to make human rights impact assessment of AI technology and companies who own it.\n\n\nTwo computer scientists and a cultural scientist get hit by a driver-less car: Situating knowledge in the cross-disciplinary study of F-A-T in machine learning\nThis tutorial focused on positionality and attempted to give audience first-hand experience of how researchers’ perspectives and approaches can differ across many disciplines. After a brief introduction, we were split into several groups and read three papers all from different disciplines such as computer science, social science and philosophy. The computer science paper was about identifying racial bias in online comments. The social science paper discussed intricate relation between racial minority and their particular usage of certain words in English. In addition to using several questionable methods, the authors from the first paper clearly lacked domain knowledge. Thus, the conclusion of this paper inevitably made a blanket statement on the topic, which was inaccurate and ignorant. It was a good hands-on exercise on the importance of domain knowledge and collaboration across multiple disciplines, which is usually required in FAccT-related studies."

    "section": "Main conference",
    "text": "Main conference\nThere were three keynote talks and 15 sessions of talks for accepted papers. These sessions are grouped into the following topics:\n\nAccountability\nExplainability\nAuditing/Assessment\nFairness\nEthics and Policy\nValues\nData collection\nCognition and education\nSensitive attributes\n\n\nKeynote\nThey were given by Ayanna Howard from Georgia Institute of Technology, Yochai Benkler from Harvard Law School, Nani Jansen Reventlow from Digital Freedom Fund, which supports partners in Europe to advance digital rights through strategic litigation. Howard’s talk was about human bias in trust in AI. She provided examples from her experiments using robots and how human participants interacted with them. In one of her experiments, she found that humans can overly trust AI decision (a robot’s decision in the experiment). She mentioned that understanding cognitive bias is crucial when designing an AI system. Benkler’s talk was on the role of technology in political economy. He discussed how technology has been contributing to the increase of productivity but also aggravating the concentration of wealth, which led to more severe economic inequality. Finally, Reventlow discussed how we can sometimes use litigation strategically to make industry and government more accountable. She mentioned that the best way to build a strategic litigation case is to make the litigation itself embedded in a broader case and to bring various stakeholders such as activists and policymakers together.\n\n\nAccountability\nThe first paper2 criticizes that the term “algorithmic accountability” is inherently vague and thus it needs specification in terms of “the actor, forum and forum, the relationship between the two, the content and criteria of the account, and finally the consequences which may result from the account.” Raji et al.3 also mentioned that due to this vagueness, there is a gap in algorithmic accountability. The authors showed ways to overcome this by illustrating how other industries such as aerospace, medical devices, and finance conduct audit and carry out governance. Finally, Katell et al.4 gave an actual example where researchers co-developed algorithmic accountability interventions (“Algorithmic Equity Toolkit”) by adopting participatory action research methods in collaboration with American Civil Liberties Union of Washington (ACLU-Washington).\n\n\nExplainability\nThere were many interesting papers in this section. Sokol and Flach5 provided convenient yet exhaustive explainability fact sheets for project assessment. Malgieri and Kaminski6 criticized that even though explainability is addressed in GDPR, there is no consensus on what it entails. They also made an excellent point that explanation does not necessarily provide justification on fairness. Barocas et al.7 criticized the faulty assumptions often made when models provide explainability or actionability. For instance, to change the model prediction of an individual, the model may make suggestion to the person to make more money, which is not exactly easily actionable. They suggest that there should be fiduciary obligations on explainability, and we should study how people actually respond to the explanations. Lucic et al8 created Monte Carlo Bounds for Reasonable Predictions (MC-BRP), which generates feature values that would result in a reasonable prediction (i.e. a range of predicted values), based on the n most important features, and general trends between each feature and the target variable, such as whether the target value increase with a certain feature. Bhatt et al.9 conducted a survey on how industry handles explainability in deployment. Their results showed that explainability is mostly used for debugging and the goals of explainability are not clearly defined. Some ML engineers they talked to also addressed that there is technical challenge in real-time deployment for explainability. Hancox-Li10 discussed so-called “Rashomon effect” where multiple models of similar performance provide different explanations, which makes difficult for stakeholders to choose which explanation to believe.\n\n\nAuditing/Assessment\nBlack et al.11 presented a model-agnostic tool that can be used in the exploration stage to identify discriminatory behavior in ML systems. Their concept is roughly based on counterfactuals but they addressed that coming up with a right causal diagram is often challenging. Instead, they used a technique called an optimal transport map, which transforms one probability distribution into another, while minimizing a given cost defined over their respective supports. For example, we might use an optimal transport map from the distribution of men to women in order to obtain a (female, male) pair of inputs with which to query the model. If the model’s output differs for these two people, then it may be evidence that the model discriminates on the basis of gender. Rodolfa et al.12 did a case study in collaboration with a local government to show how to balance equity and model performance depending on which fairness metric to choose and how it affects certain demographics. Lum13 audited a pre-trial risk assessment tool from San Francisco, CA, and found that overbooking (i.e., booking charges that are dropped or end in an acquittal) increased the recommended level of pre-trial supervision. Sánchez-Monedero et al.14 criticized that some automated hiring systems developed in the US were used in the UK and other European countries where the transparency and data protection law background is quite different from the US. Borradaile et al.15 investigated how the Corvallis (Oregon) Police Department has used social media to monitor certain users and found that they have outsourced the task and racial bias existed among those who were monitored.\n\n\nFairness\nSlack et al.16 developed Fair-MAML, which demonstrates K shot learning for cases where the number of training samples is extremely small. Barabas et al.17 introduced a concept of “studying up” commonly used in the field of anthropology, which refers to studying “the relative upper hand” in terms of the amount of agency and authority they have in a given context such as established legal systems or law enforcement. Pujol et al.18 showed a study of conflict between differential privacy and fairness, and suggested to customize privacy implementation for each assignment instead of using differential privacy for all tasks. Liu et al.19 looked at the complicated interplay between the deployed model for automated decision making in hiring, and individuals who are affected by the model. Because the model’s decision rewards people disproportionately, people tend to change their behavior in response to how these decisions are made. The authors showed that subsidizing the cost of investment create better equilibria for the disadvantaged group. Yang et al.20 examined the ImageNet dataset and found problematic behavior in how “person” category was constructed, for instance, due to lack of diversity in images and bias in annotation. Binns21 investigated the notion of individual and group fairness being in conflict and clarified it being based on a misconception, which requires resolution from a broader context and by focusing on the sources of unfairness.\n\n\nEthics and Policy\nWashington and Kuo22 found that AI ethics codes from corporations conflated consumers with society and were largely silent on agency. They introduced the concept of digital differential vulnerability to explain disproportionate exposures to harm within data technology and suggest recommendations for future ethics codes. Bietti23 discussed a current trend in tech industry where self-regulation or hands-off governance prevails and “ethics” is increasingly identified with technology companies’ self-regulatory efforts with shallow appearances of ethical behavior, so-called “ethics washing.” Abebe et al.24 states that computational research has valuable roles to play in addressing social problems.\n\n\nValues\nDotan and Milli25 the rise and fall of certain model types. They argue that the rise of a model- type is self-reinforcing and the way model-types are evaluated encodes loaded social and political values such as centralization of power, privacy, and environmental concerns. Venkatasubramanian and Alfano26 criticizes the current conceptualization of algorithmic recourse, the systematic process of reversing unfavorable decisions by algorithms and bureaucracies across a range of counterfactual scenarios, and suggests both stakeholder and expert panels should establish acceptable action sets (i.e., not one-way), make a role for fiduciaries who are charged to act on behalf of those they represent, and handle the changes over time (i.e., ongoing engagement).\n\n\nData collection\nIn this section, various authors criticized that the current data collection practices in industry and governments lack transparency and standardized approach. Geiger et al.27 investigated human- annotated datasets widely used in the ML community and found that the so-called benchmark datasets have questionable reliability in the first place. Marda and Narayan28 investigated predictive policing system in New Delhi to discover the lack of public accountability mechanisms, biases that are present within Delhi Police’s data collection practices and how these translate into predictive policing.\n\n\nCognition and education\nBates et al.29 collected data from MSc Data Science teaching team based at University of Sheffield to reflect on their experiences of working at the intersection of disciplines such as FATE (i.e., FAT + ethics). Based on their findings, they suggest to create empathetic learning spaces for interdisciplinary teaching teams and collaborate with decolonization experts to avoid Eurocentrism with data science competency in mind.\n\n\nSensitive attributes\nBogen et al.30 brings up the topic of data collection on sensitive attributes such as race and gender specifically for interventions for antidiscrimination. They illustrated case studies from several industry domains such as credit, employment, and healthcare, and found that the practices widely varies across the domains and also within in certain cases, such as whether the companies are bound by legal restrictions or they can collect self-reported identification as data. The paper encourages various stakeholders to actively help chart a path forward that takes both policy goals and technical needs into account."

    "text": "CRAFT sessions\nCRAFT stands for Critiquing and Rethinking Accountability, Fairness and Transparency (CRAFT) session. These are designed to bring more diverse voices on FAT* topics. I attended the following sessions.\n\nWhen Not to Design, Build, or Deploy\nGiven the recent push for moratoria on facial recognition, protests around the sale of digital technologies, and the ongoing harms to marginalized groups from automated systems such as risk prediction, a broader discussion around how, when, and why to say no as academics, practitioners, activists, and society, seems both relevant and urgent.\nSome of the notable topics the panel discussed include more case studies on the unnecessary surveillance driven by AI systems, raising tech workers’ agency (accompanied with ethics training for engineers), and making interventions at various points in a production pipeline, and so on. When it comes to how we would formalize the effort in terms of policy, some mentioned that engineers can potentially make released models more difficult to replicate, societies can apply similar regulations to AI as they do to any weapons, and governments can bring legal enforcement on the issue.\n\n\nCentering Disability Perspectives in Algorithmic Fairness, Accountability & Transparency\nIt is vital to consider the unique risks and impacts of algorithmic decision-making for people with disabilities. The diverse nature of potential disabilities poses unique challenges. Many disabled people choose not to disclose their disabilities, making auditing and accountability tools particularly hard to design and operate. Further, the variety inherent in disability poses challenges for collecting representative training data in any quantity sufficient to better train more inclusive and accountable algorithms.\nSpeakers mentioned that disability perspectives combine AI systems design and accessibility issues. This is similar to the lack of diversity issue in training data in face recognition. If deployed AI systems cannot recognize disabled people. This requires ML engineers to consider whom their models might fail for and consider inclusive and viable solutions in advance. The disabled community also has intersectionality because how disabled are represented in the media and society do not reflect the diverse spectrum of the disabled community. This is also related to that various demographic groups have different socioeconomic and genetic backgrounds that might affect the probability of them to become disabled."

    "text": "Reflection and suggestions\nOverall, it was nice to see the conference growing rapidly every year. I appreciated the organizers’ move to create separate tracks for social science and law, to encourage more holistic views in research. I enjoyed the CRAFT sessions very much. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the FAT* topics, sometimes I sensed that the one-way communication of the talk format has severe limitations on how we move further from here. The CRAFT sessions were the attempts to mitigate this issue and also bring the ground workers such as activists, lawyers, policy makers, industry data scientists together.\nI also see there are room for improvements. First of all, every talk was strictly limited to 8 minutes, which was too short. Especially when it comes to computer-science papers, some speakers showed many math equations on their slides, which is probably not the best strategy for the 8-min talk. Some speakers did a great job of laying out the background knowledge but not all of them. If we are truly interested in multidisciplinary effort, improving the communication is crucial.\nSpeaking of communication, at the very end of the conference, there was a townhall meeting and the Q&A was extremely short. I think this should be more focused because we are a group of various backgrounds and to make impactful changes from our research, it is important to open the floor for more discussions. This can be potentially mitigated by organizing birds-of- feather (BOF) sessions or group-lunch for certain topics. The conference is growing fast, which means we will have a lot of newcomers every year. It would be better for them to have easy-to- network venues.\nThe conference this year used an anonymous board to submit questions online and did not use their Slack channel much. I understand the need for anonymity but the Slack channel was extremely useful in terms of establishing networks between researchers from different domain and socializing. Tutorial preparation could have also been announced on the Slack channel as well like last year. There were some tutorials where the attendees didn’t get enough information about the preparation and it was a missed opportunity.\nThis issue was brought up last year but the conference may want to attempt to create a shared knowledge base to educate the attendees to have everyone on the same page. There are many definitions of key terms such as fairness, and there are important historic case studies researchers talk about all the time. It would be nice to have standardized material that is open to all attendees before the conference so that we can all well-informed and follow the conference material more easily.\nThis might be a radical and debatable idea, but if the conference is truly interested in tackling practical and more current issues related to the FAT* topics, they might consider bringing more industry people, especially the ones who are often criticized by various researchers to make them more accountable and help them create a better solution, instead of ostracizing them. Not all companies may participate but considering the urgency of the issue, it wouldn’t do any harm for us to reach out to industry and bring them to the table. This will also provide opportunities for researchers as well if the industry stakeholders share their difficulties of implementing good AI governance in practice, and the researchers can help tackling them."

    "text": "Some people work with data where the meaning of features (columns) is very clear because only common sense is required. For instance, even without a schema, in a housing price dataset, a column called “number of rooms” would be the number of rooms in a housing unit, and it’s very likely that the values of this column will be integers.\nIn hardware (microprocessor) verification, it’s often impossible to understand the meaning of the columns. If you are an ML practitioner without hardware engineering background, you can nag verification engineers to explain it but it’s very likely that you wouldn’t completely understand, and there are hundreds and thousands of columns that need explanation. Even if you do have the background, depending on the product type, it’s likely that you can’t have full understanding of all columns.\nBesides, sometimes you need to work with so called “mixed data type” arrays. An example would be an array of boolean and float such as [True, 0.0]. If you use pandas to read this type of data, you should know that it infers the data type of an array like this as object quite often. This inference is done by the pandas.DataFrame.infer_objects method. However, a lot of different types of mixed arrays can be inferred as object dtype. This “blanket” approach might be useful for practical data handling but it is not suitable for more accurate and granular type inference. If the goal is to understand the actual content of the arrays.\nYou may not have known that pandas has another type inference method in their api: pandas.api.types.infer_dtype, which provides granular type inference and allows to ignore null values (skipna=True). This method returns a name of inferred type as a string such as \"boolean\" or \"floating\". For the comprehensive list of the type names, see the pandas documentation.\nThis notebook compares the two type inference methods of pandas (pandas.DataFrame.infer_objects and pandas.api.types.infer_dtype) when they are faced with various cases of mixed data type arrays. For the comparison, I used exhaustive combination of None, array(list), str, bool, float, int data to generate various mixed arrays, and then applied the two inference methods to compare the results.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np"

    "text": "Conclusions\nHardware verification datasets often do not have schema and the feature meanings cannot be understood without extremely specialized domain knowledge. The fact that the datasets often have mixed data type arrays makes it difficult for ML practitioners to understand the content of the datasets. Therefore, type inference becomes an important step in the data digestion stage.\nWe can use pandas for type inference. But it has two methods: pandas.DataFrame.infer_objects, pandas.api.types.infer_dtype. The former (pandas.DataFrame.infer_objects) is designed to return practical python data types that can be easily cast on arrays. Thus its type inference tends to adopt a blanket approach where inferred type should work without any further steps to handle the data immediately.\nOn the other hand, pandas.api.types.infer_dtype does a more granular type inference job where it can also ignore na values. However, it returns string values as a result, not python types. Therefore, we need a further process to use this information for type casting such as \"boolean\" -&gt; bool."

    "text": "One of the reasons I try to attend the FAccT conference is because I always get inspired by novel approaches from this community to quantify and measure social concepts such as fairness. However, this approach has its own demise. It’s possible that these attempts get lost in the weeds while discussing abstract and theoretical aspects of the models which can easily alienate researchers from the real world. Today’s keynote by Katrina Ligett from Hebrew University addressed this issue.\nDuring the talk, she discussed the pros and cons of using mathematical models in general, but also in the context of studying FAccT-related topics. Many positive aspects of mathematical models she mentioned were exactly the same reasons why I have been drawn to this area; mathematical models are explicit about their assumptions such as what’s included and what’s not, usually come with provable guarantees, and provide solid foundations for future research.

    "text": "One of the reasons I try to attend the FAccT conference is because I always get inspired by novel approaches from this community to quantify and measure social concepts such as fairness. However, this approach has its own demise. It’s possible that these attempts get lost in the weeds while discussing abstract and theoretical aspects of the models which can easily alienate researchers from the real world. Today’s keynote by Katrina Ligett from Hebrew University addressed this issue.\nDuring the talk, she discussed the pros and cons of using mathematical models in general, but also in the context of studying FAccT-related topics. Many positive aspects of mathematical models she mentioned were exactly the same reasons why I have been drawn to this area; mathematical models are explicit about their assumptions such as what’s included and what’s not, usually come with provable guarantees, and provide solid foundations for future research. Mathematical models can also easily become a fig leaf by letting bad actors hide behind the models’ specificity and complexity.

Being able to review something means that we can hold companies easily accountable for the consequences from ADM systems, which already have serious issues of lack of accountability. The authors borrowed the idea from administrative law’s approach to reviewing human decision-making, and presents a practical and holistic framework. The suggested idea consists of various parts such as commissioning, model building, decision-making, investigation, group deliberation, and assessment. I liked their idea originated from law because this will help legislators regulate ADMs.\nSpeaking of regulation, An Action-Oriented AI Policy Toolkit for Technology Audits by Community Advocates and Activists was an excellent paper in that it provided an example of algorithmic equity toolkit designed for diverse stakeholders. I assume it was possible because the authors come from diverse background; computer science, social and political science, and activism. The toolkit aims to increase public participation for AI-policy action and consists of various formats including flowcharts, maps, and questionnaires. With this diverse methods, it tries to deliver comprehensive of information of AI technology such as the type, functionality, and its potential impact. This looks like a handy way to facilitate communication between many different stakeholders such as communities, government officials, and even technologists."

    "section": "Accountability and Recourse",
    "text": "Accountability and Recourse\nDesigning Accountable Systems suggests that accountability requires a causal model because if something happens and we need to hold someone accountable for the consequences. The authors bring an interesting distinction between forward- and backward-looking causalities. When we build causal models, we use the forward-looking approach such as “A causes B”. However, when we need to use causality for accountability, we lean on the backward-looking approach such as “the fact that A happened last year causes B to die yesterday”. Thus, the authors use Structural Causal Models to evaluate a system’s design for accountability.\nIn a similar context, Algorithmic Recourse: from Counterfactual Explanations to Interventions also emphasizes the importance of causal models. Many previous studies on counterfactuals as a means of algorithmic recourse overlooked how to achieve the counterfactual scenarios. Without addressing the feasibility, algorithms may provide nonsensical counterfactual explanations such as “in order to get a loan, change your ethnicity”. This study shows that causal models can mitigate this issue because causal explanations inherently avoids nonsensical explanations from the beginning.\nFinally, Epistemic Values in Feature Importance Methods: Lessons From Feminist Epistemology looks at explainable AI (particularly feature importance) through the lense of feminism studies, which was highly enlightening. The authors say explanations and epistemology (study of human knowledge) are inseparable; useful explanations have epistemic values. And providing AI explanations in a feminist way is means we focus on understanding of situated knowledge and avoid totalization. To elaborate, explanations should respect different perspectives, particularly from marginalized individuals, and encourage active conversation about the knowledge. If I look back on how I used feature importance as a tool for explainable AI, it is true that it’s usually a one-way communication that was static and lacked communication with stakeholders. The authors suggest that it’s crucial to evaluate explanation in context and keep it interactive. More importantly, since explanations can often be used as an authoritative way, it’s important to encourage users to avoid over-trusting one interpretation, which was such a thoughtful insight."

Often people try to remove these spurious features from the dataset. In fact, this practice is not just limited to applications that use datasets with sensitive attributes. ML practitioners drop correlated or spurious features to build more robust models. Removing Spurious Features can Hurt Accuracy and Affect Groups Disproportionately shows that removing these features can lead to performance drop. The authors mitigated the problem by using a technique called Robust Self-Training. The authors of this paper also investigated how the performance drop is manifested among different groups in the data.\nFairness Through Robustness: Investigating Robustness Disparity in Deep Learning is an interesting paper that they define the group fairness in terms of model vulnerability against adversarial attacks. They first address that in deep learning models, it is possible for a certain subgroup to be more vulnerable to those attacks, and thus the model is less robust for particular subgroups. You can easily picture this as a classification with a decision boundary. If the model is not robust and changes its decision boundary when the attack occurs, samples that are closer to the original boundary may be more likely to be misclassified with the attack. The authors identified that for deep learning models, this is a complex matter because it is about data drift and the learning process of the model. However, as a first attempt, they added a simple regularization term to the model to equalize the robustness bias among the subgroups in some examples."

Academic researchers now agree that police contact is a significant contributing factor to health inequality and particuarly to early mortality for people of color. The police brutality in the US is also internationally recognizied such as in the 2014 report by the UN Committee Against Torture: &gt; The Committee is concerned about numerous reports of police brutality and excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, in particular against persons belonging to certain racial and ethnic groups, immigrants and LGBTI individuals, racial profiling by police and immigration offices and growing militarization of policing activities.\nIf the issue of police brutality is this severe, one would expect that there might be a national database of police shooting incidents. Unfortunately, the US goverment does not maintain a national database of police shooting incidents. Rather, most efforts to collect police shooting incidents were done by journalists. D. Brian Burghart’s Fatal Encounter and Washington Post’s Fatal Force are famous examples. Some local goverments have pulic data portals for police shooting but they are mostly at a city level and it’s rare to find a state-level database."

The term officer-involved shooting refers to two different types of incidents: 1. Shooting by officers. In this case, people harmed during a shooting incident are civilians. 2. Shooting of officers. Here, those harmed during an incident are police officers.\nThis was possible thanks to the legistation in 2015 (HB 1036) which requires all officer-involved shootings to be reported to the Office of Attorney General (OAG) of Texas. In 2017, another bill was passed, which now requires OAG to investigate missing reports and to fine law enforcement agencies if the reports were delayed. This data is is available in public in the OAG website. Every report in the data is saved as a PDF file, which makes it challenging to digest."

    "text": "Data collection takes a huge amount of effort\nMany ML practicioners and data scientists are usually detached from data collection process, which makes it easy for us to overlook the importance of the effort and cost of data collection. Thus, in this section, I’d like to describe the data collection process for the OIS data briefly to show you that data doesn’t just appear for free.\nFirst and foremost, for a government dataset like this, legislations and polices should be established as a consorted effort to collect data formally. Now every law enforcement agency has to file a one-page report (see the example here) whenever they identify an officer-involved shooting incident in their jurisdiction. This OIS report contains many pieces of valuable information. To list a few: - Date and location of the incident (location as detailed as street address) - Demographic information (gender, race, and age) of the person who was shot by police and the police officer who shot the person - Severity of the incident (binary; injury or death) and whether the person shot possessed a deadly weapon - Whether multiple officers were involved, whether the officer was on duty, and so on.\nTo acquire this data, every month, TJI submits an open records request via OAG’s online portal. Luckily, we get a tabular data (not the PDF files) in a csv file format and our director Eva manually inspects and fixes errors. In this process, we contact the agencies and ask for clarification for errors. Finally, the data is added to the existing data and the data on our website is updated. You can download the OIS data on our website."

    "text": "The OAG’s annual report lacks insight. Can we do better?\nSince the legislations were passed, the OAG publishes an annual report to provide a summary of all OIS incidents in Texas in a given year. The two-page 2020 report has only three paragraphs where they discuss the data:\n\nFrom January 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020, there were one hundred ninety-four (194) separate incidents statewide involving peace officer shootings with a firearm that caused injury or death. Those incidents resulted in one hundred ten (110) deaths and eighty-four (84) injuries to individuals. Additionally, twenty-nine (29) peace officers were injured and six (6) were killed.\nOf the individuals (non-peace officers) who were either injured or killed in these incidents, sixty-seven (67) were Hispanic, sixty-three (63) were Caucasian, sixty-one (61) were African-American, one (1) was Asian or Pacific Islander, one (1) was not available and one (1) was of another nationality or race. One hundred seventy-six (176) of these incidents involved individuals who were reported to be carrying a deadly weapon; eighteen (18) did not.\nThe reason for the officers’ involvement are broken down as follows: one hundredfour (104) Emergency Calls or Requests for Assistance; twenty-five (25) involving Execution of a Warrant; twenty (20) Hostage, Barricade and Other Emergency Situations; thirty-eight (38) Traffic Stops; and forty-one (41) Other Uncategorized Situations.\n\nThis summary from the OAG report has several issues: 1. The data is aggregated at the state level. Texas has over 250 counties and that granular information is nowhere to be found. 2. There are no intersectional analyses. There are counts based on race and the reasons for officer involvement but that’s all. 3. There are no multi-year analyses. They have been collecting the data since 2015 but year-to-year comparison doesn’t exist. 4. There is no disclosure on data preprocessing. When analyzing a dataset, one has to make numerous decisions how they handle the data such as data exclusion, imputation, discretization, aggregation, and so on. For public data, preprocessing information is a key to transparancey and accountability. 5. There is missing information. The OIS report has information such as age demographics, report dates, on-duty-ness of officers, etc. However, none of that information is addressed in the report.\nTo address these points, I’ve decided to analyze the Texas police shooting data in the following way: 1. Comparison with reference datasets. If we want to make a value assessment on the OIS dataset, we need a target that we can compare with. To do this, I used US Census data and mortality data from Texas Department of Health Services. 2. County-level analyses. Texas nas numerous counties and some are quite different from others. This aspect should be reflected. 3. Various intersectional analyses. We can find many different ways to create interesting intersections of the data. Given the serious racial bias in police brutality, I made sure we look at intersections that contain race demographics. 4. Multi-year analyses. This way, we can idenfity whether there is any temporal trend in the analyses. 5. Reproducible and publically available data preprocessing information. I published all the code, visualizations, raw & intermediate datasets, and Jupyter notebooks on our GitHub repository. 6. Analyses on age demogrphics. This was never addressed in the OAG’s annual reports, and I made sure we utilize this information.\nIn this post, I am going to focus on several major findings from my original report (but updated with 2020 information) focusing on the race demogrphics."

Interestingly, most counties have a very small number of incidents and more than half of the data come from the top 5 most populous counties (annotated in the figure); Harris, Bexas, Dallas, Tarrant, and Travis.\nThe race composition of all the civilians shot by police in our data shows that the proportion of each race group, white, Black and Hispanic is comparable.\n\n\nCode\n\nplot.plot_pie(df_civilian, 'civilian_race', colors=cols_race, remove_labels=True, \n              title='Race Composition in the OIS Data\\n(All Counties)',\n              figsize=(4, 4), \n              fontsize=13,              \n              bbox_to_anchor=(1.5, 0.1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if we focus on the top 5 counties, it is now clear that Black people are shot more often (39.3%) than white (25.1%) and Hispanic (32.2%).\n\n\nCode\n\ndf_civilian_top5 = df_civilian.loc[df_civilian['incident_county'].isin(top5_locs), :]\nplot.plot_pie(df_civilian_top5, 'civilian_race', colors=cols_race, remove_labels=True, \n              title='Race Composition in the OIS Data\\n(Top 5 Counties)',\n              figsize=(4, 4),\n              fontsize=13,\n              bbox_to_anchor=(1.5, 0.1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack people are overrepresented in police shooting incidents\nAt this point, one might think that this is simply because the top 5 counties have larger Black populations than other counties. It’s true that in Texas, these top 5 counties with metropolitan areas have more Black people. If this hypothesis is true, this disproportionate distribution across race groups should be reflected in the census data.\n\n\nCode\n\nplot.plot_scatter_compare_race_incident_vs_population_pulled(\n    df_civilian, \n    df_census,\n    n_county=5,\n    annotate=True,\n    xylim=0.8,\n    figsize=(4, 4),\n    title='Racial Bias in Police Shooting\\n(Top 5 Counties, 2016-2020)')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, I found that that was not the case. The plot above shows race representation of general population (US census, x axis) and of the police shooting incidents (OIS data, y axis). The dotted diagonal line shows equal representation between the census and the police shooting data. Any data points above the line indicate overrepresentation in the OIS data compared with the general population data (census).\nThe four colored dots represent the race groups in our data; Black (B), Hispanic (H), white (w), and others (O). The annotated numbers next to the dots show the rate of overrepresentation in the police shooting data of a race group compared to the census data. This analysis shows that Black people are 2.4 times overrepresented in police shooting compared with general population in these top 5 counties. The figure below shows that this pattern is in fact consistent across all 5 counties although the rate of overrepresentation for Black people is much higher particuarly for Harris and Dallas counties.\n\n\nCode\n\nplot.plot_scatter_compare_race_incident_vs_population(\n    df_civilian, \n    df_census, \n    fontsize=13,\n    title='Racial Bias in Police Shooting (2016-2020)')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack and Hispanic people are overrepresented in fatal police shooting incidents\nSince the OIS data has a column that shows severity of incidents in terms of whether victims were killed or just injured, I decided to use the morality data of general population published by Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) to examine the racial bias in fatal police shooting incidents.\n\n\nCode\n\ndf_civilian_died = df_civilian[df_civilian['died']==1]\ndf_death_county = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/texas-justice-initiative/officer_involved_shooting/master/Data/Raw/Census/mortality_rate_by_county.csv', index_col='County')\ndf_death_county = df_death_county.drop('TOTAL', axis=1)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nplot.plot_scatter_compare_race_incident_vs_population_pulled(\n    df_civilian, \n    df_death_county,\n    n_county=5,\n    annotate=True,\n    xylim=0.8,\n    figsize=(4, 4),\n    title='Racial Bias in Fatal Police Shooting\\n(Top 5 Counties, 2016-2020)')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the comparison with the census data, I found the overrepresentation of Black people in the fatal police shooting incidents (2.1 times overrepresented). In addition, Hispanic people were overrepresented as well (1.6 times). This pattern of overrepresentation of Black and Hispanic people was consistent across all 5 counties:\n\n\nCode\n\nplot.plot_scatter_compare_race_incident_vs_population(\n    df_civilian_died, \n    df_death_county, \n    fontsize=13,\n    title='Racial Bias in Fatal Police Shooting (2016-2020)')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung Black men are overrepresented in fatal police shooting incidents\nI found a similar result when I looked at the intersection of race and age demographics. In the figure below, I’ve compared the race composition of mortality data (left, “County Deaths”) and the OIS data (right, “Deaths by OIS”) in various age groups (5 subplots). I used the same color palette as above (red for white, blue for Black, and dark gray for Hispanic). If there is no disproportionate race representation in the fatal police shooting data per age group, the two stacked bars (general population’s mortality and fata police shooting) in a subplot should look similar.\nHowever, it is clear that Black people are overrepresented especially in younger age groups (ages 15-24 particularly). In the ages 15-24, Black people were about 3 times overrepresented in fatal police shooting incidents. This pattern quickly disappears as we move towards older age groups (plots on the right side).\n\n\nCode\n\nrace_list = ['WHITE', 'BLACK', 'HISPANIC', 'OTHER']\n\n# mortality data by age and gender (male only)\ndf_death_age_male = pd.read_csv(\n    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/texas-justice-initiative/officer_involved_shooting/master/Data/Raw/Census/mortality_rate_by_age_male.csv', \n    index_col='Age').iloc[1:, :]\nage_range_names = df_death_age_male.index.values\n\n# intersection of race and gender\ndf_civilian_died_male_age = df_civilian_died.loc[df_civilian_died['civilian_gender']=='MALE'].groupby(['civilian_age_binned', 'civilian_race'])['date_incident'].count().unstack().fillna(0)[race_list]\n\n# selecting the age groups of interest\ninds_age_binned = np.arange(2, 7)\ndf_civilian_died_male_age = df_civilian_died_male_age.loc[inds_age_binned, :].drop('OTHER', axis=1)\ndf_death_age_male = df_death_age_male.iloc[inds_age_binned, :].drop('TOTAL', axis=1)\n\n# convert counts to proportions\ndf_civilian_died_male_age_pct = preprocess.pct(df_civilian_died_male_age, 1)\ndf_death_age_male_pct = preprocess.pct(df_death_age_male, 1)\n\n# changing the index for plotting\ndf_civilian_died_male_age_pct.index = ['Age {}'.format(s) for s in age_range_names[inds_age_binned]]\ndf_death_age_male_pct.index = ['Age {}'.format(s) for s in age_range_names[inds_age_binned]]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nplot.plot_stackedbar_compare_ratio(\n    df_civilian_died_male_age_pct,\n    df_death_age_male_pct,\n    df_civilian_died_male_age.sum(axis=1).astype(int), \n    severity='Deaths', \n    legend=False,\n    figsize=(10, 6)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident cause for Black people is often “Other”\nI found another example of racial disparity in how law enforcement agencies labeled the cause of incidents. The OIS report provides a list of five categories as a potential cause of an incident; “Traffic Stop”, “Emergency/Request for Assistance”, “Execution of a Warrant”, “Hostage/Barricade/Other Emergency”, and “Other”. Obviously, the last category, “Other” has the lowest accountability and transparency because it can be anything.\n\n\nCode\n\nincident_causes_list = [\"Traffic Stop\", \"Emergency/Request for Assistance\", \"Execution of a Warrant\", \"Hostage/Barricade/Other Emergency\", \"Other\"]\nincident_causes_list_sorted = df_civilian[incident_causes_list].sum(axis=0).sort_values(ascending=False).index\ndf_civilian_top5 = df_civilian.loc[df_civilian['incident_county'].isin(top5_locs), :]\ndf_civilian_incident_race_top5 = df_civilian_top5.groupby('civilian_race')[incident_causes_list_sorted].sum().loc[race_list, incident_causes_list_sorted]\ndf_civilian_incident_race_top5_pct = preprocess.pct(df_civilian_incident_race_top5, 0)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(11, 3))\ndf_civilian_incident_race_top5_pct.T[::-1].plot(kind='barh', stacked=True, ax=ax, legend=False, width=0.75, color=cols_race)\nplot.annotate(ax, 'h', 'percent', fontsize=10)\nax.set(xlim=[0, 100])\nax.set_yticklabels([s + ' ({})'.format(n) for s, n in zip(df_civilian_incident_race_top5.columns, \n                                                          df_civilian_incident_race_top5.sum(axis=0).values)][::-1], fontsize=10)\nfig.legend(race_list, ncol=4, bbox_to_anchor=(0.81, 0.09), fontsize=10)\n\nfig.suptitle('Race Demographics by Incident Cause (Top 5 Counties)', fontsize=12, x=0.6, y=1.03)\nfig.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen incident cause data is broken down by race groups, the “Other” category shows unusually high proportion of Black people. This means that when OIS reports were filed, more than half of the times, the incident cause was identified as “Other” when the victim was a Black person. Again, considering this category’s low accountability and transparency, this racial disparity was another concerning example."

Every presenter has an option to submit a written proceedings and I decided to participate. I’ve never had a chance to present my ML work as a paper in industry, and so I thought it would be a good experience.\nI was a bit intimated when the conference committees said authors should submit their manuscripts as pull requests in their proceedings repository in GitHub. They also said manuscripts should be written in reStructuredText. I have used git for many years but I have limited experience in collaborating with others on GitHub. Plus, I’ve never used reStructuredText (I’ve only used Markdown) and also have never written an academic manuscript in markup languages.\nIn short, I eventually became to really enjoy the process of using markup languages for writing manuscripts and using GitHub for review. I will briefly talk about my experience at the SciPy and talk about why I think you should give it a try."

    "text": "Scientific writing in markup languages\nThere was a bit of learning curve but it wasn’t too difficult to get used to the reStructuredText syntax because there were some similarities between Markdown and reStructuredText (rst). The conference committee also provided examples. They also provided me with a PDF builder that I could run locally. This helped me preview the final version of the PDF when it’s fully rendered. This was useful especially to decide the location of figures. There was a custom LaTeX builder in their repository too, which was invaluable.\nCompared with existing word processor softwares such as MS Word or Google Docs, using markup languages pose some challenges to the first-time users. First, you need to learn the syntax. There are some limitations on styling because not everything is rendered automatically (e.g., LaTeX) and sometimes you need to play with html and css files to get a more complex page layout.\nHowever, there are many benefits as well:\n\nEvery styling is written explicitly (e.g., ** for bold in Markdown) and thus it is easily discoverable.\nCode snippets can be automatically rendered in a standardized way.\nIt’s easy and fast to publish the manuscript online, which makes it easy to share.\nFinally, with a right document builder, the above-mentioned pain points can be mitigated.\nIt is much easier and convenient to review the manuscript (see below)."

It was pretty straightforward because I was working alone in my own branch (you can find my pull request here). A few weeks later, two reviewers started commenting on my pull request. The whole process was quite simple and very similar to a typical review process in academia: reviewers left comments on certain parts of the manuscript and I responded. It also reminded me of a code review process. This year, I volunteered at the SciPy 2020 as a reviewer. I reviewed a paper that was submitted as a pull request."

    "text": "Benefits of GitHub for reviewing manuscripts\nWith these experiences, I learned that markup language with GitHub review process provides many benefits for scientific writing, compared with MS Word or Google Docs which are used in typical (academic) review process:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkup + GitHub review\nMS Word or Google Docs + Academic review\n\n\n\n\nDiscover exact changes\nYes\nPossible but can be confusing when many changes occur in one place\n\n\nChange versions easily\nYes\nMay need multiple versions (separate files)\n\n\nTrack communications\nYes\nChallenging because comments happen in the margin, which has a very limited space. Otherwise, they are addressed in a separate space (like a letter).\n\n\nText override or unauthorized edits\nNo (permission needed)\nCan happen if tracking option is off or multiple files exist\n\n\nGroup communication\nYes\nNo. Normally reviewers don’t talk to each other. Reviewers communicate individually with authors.\n\n\nImmediate responsiveness\nHigh (online comments)\nLow. Letters or emails need to be exchanged, which can take months.\n\n\nCommunication transparency\nHigh\nAlmost none (academic review). Normally double-blind. A reviewer can’t normally read other reviews during the review process.\n\n\nPublic transparency\nYes (public repositories)\nAlmost none. Very rare to publish the whole conversation between reviewers and authors.\n\n\nOne place for everything\nYes\nNo. Normally non-document type files exist in a different place.\n\n\n\nIn short, the main benefit of using GitHub for reviewing manuscript comes from that GitHub is an excellent version control tool. It prevents reviews (new changes) and the manuscript (original file) from getting mixed up and allows us to track changes meticulously.\nAnother huge benefit is transparency. If our repository and pull requests are public, the entire review process can be seen by anyone. This way, every decision making process is tracked and stays public, which minimizes potential dispute or abuse between authors and reviewers. Given that academia is not capable of perfect self-governance and some academic disciplines have reproducibility problems, transparent review process like this can become a solution."

Some people are more familiar with traditional word processing softwares where styles are immediately rendered and more style options are available. However, based on my experience with the SciPy conference, especially, being at the both ends of the review process, I can say the benefits of using markup language for scientific writing and using GitHub for review outweighs its caveats. Manuscripts written in markup languages can be easily reviewed in GitHub where we can utilize its excellent built-in tools to achieve better tracking, communication, and transparency."

Besides, in general, determining which measurements and metrics to use requires extreme caution. To mitigate these problems, the authors came up with two criteria; construct reliability and construct validity. The former checks whether similar inputs can return similar measurements. The latter checks whether measurements are meaningful and useful such as whether they capture relevant events, or whether the impact from using the measurements has been addressed."

    "text": "Language Models\nWhat happens when an authoritarian government and AI meet? Censorship of Online Encyclopedias: Implications for NLP Models explores how censorship in training data influence downstream processes in NLP applications using Chinese language models. One of the dataset they looked into was Baidu Baike, a censored language dataset that is often used in Chinese language models. They first checked the word embeddings and examined the position of words such as democracy, surveillance, social control, CCP (Chinese Communist Party) with respect to positive and negative words. They found that democracy often appeared with negative words and the rest in the example were the opposite. They also found similar pattern in a sentiment classification application that uses web news headlines. These results were concerning because as the authors addressed, these applications can be used to monitor public opinion and curate social media posts, essentially as a highly effective propaganda machine in a massive scale.\nFor those who’ve been following the news of Timit Gebru, an AI ethics researcher who was fired by Google, On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots:Can Language Models Be Too Big? was the paper that was at the core. The paper explores potential risks of the current trend in language modeling where researchers and practitioner pay more attention to larger models. As shown in the paper, these models have billions, sometimes trillions of parameters. The first risk the authors bring up is environmental and financial cost. Studies have shown that training a single BERT base model (without tuning) requires as much energy as a trans-American flight. This gets more problematic if you become aware that most language models serve English-speaking communities and the most impacted communities from climate change are not those. There are more sinister risks too such as training data still lacking diversity (i.e., “big” doesn’t mean “diverse.”) and lacking oversight, which creates harmful effects. Plus, since many efforts and resources in ML community go into building large language models, other research topics are naturally overlooked. The authors suggest simple mitigation strategies - step back and think; evaluate various approaches, ask yourself if we really need large models, and conduct pre-mortem analysis."

    "section": "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas",
    "text": "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\nThe story is about a place called Omelas, described as a utopian place. The author later reveals that there is a poor child locked up in a dungeon in Omelas, and this child’s poor condition is what makes Omelas a utopia. Interestingly, all people in Omelas are aware of this. But they just accept this fact and enjoy their life. At the end of the story, we find that sometimes some folks decide to walk away from Omelas to settle somewhere else.\nIn the course, the discussion was moderated by Rob Reich, a philosopher and a political science professor at Stanford (he is also one of the main faculty of this course). He asked the cohort several questions about the story.\n\nHeroes or cowards? What would you do?\nWe were first asked about those who left Omelas: are they heroes or cowards? The majority of the cohort said they were neither, which was also my answer. They were definitely not heroes because they didn’t do anything to improve the condition of the victim (the child) but simply walked away. But I also didn’t think that they were cowards because in a way, their decision of not wanting to be a part of Omelas, which included walking away from the comfortable life, should be weighed in.\nAs a follow up, we were now asked what we would do in this situation. This change of viewpoint already made me uncomfortable (later, we learned that this feeling can be called moral caffeination). I decided to poke a hole of the concept of utopia and thought a non-utopia would not mean a hellish place, meaning the cost of rescuing the child would be tolerable, which all have to think about. And if the people of Omelas share the cost together, it would be acceptable. Thus, I would first raise this question to other like-minded folks to investigate the situation and find a solution. (This definitely shows my researcher background!)\nSome cohort members shared their thoughts. It was only a handful but I was surprised to know that some seemed to have a very strong conviction of righteousness by confidently saying that they would rescue the child for sure. Prof. Reich challenged their answers by asking them what gives them the moral superiority, how they think about this unilateral decision-making and the cost other people in Omelas would pay due to their actions. I don’t think I heard a satisfying answer but that’s probably because these are all very tough questions that we have to wrestle with.\n\n\nAdulthood and complicity\nProf. Reich provided more explanations. He said, those who walk away may often have desire of keeping their hands very clean, which could be seen as a bit delusional because their walking away doesn’t make that the injustice just disappears. He said, the more important thing we need to think about is how we sit with complicity if we realize that we are complicit and in this together.\nRegarding this, several cohort members mentioned the TV show, The Good Place. In one of the episodes, the show reveals that it’s been almost impossible to get into the good place these days because everybody is complicit (e.g., unknowingly buying a t-shirt made by a company who runs a sweatshop). Some of us also pointed out that it might not be possible to “leave” Omelas in our world.\nWe only briefly mentioned this but one thing I found interesting in the story was the young people who were upset about the child’s condition in the beginning, but later got used to the fact and accepted the situation. In a way, as they grow up, they become to accept the injustice as a background noise and move on with their lives. To be honest, I think we all have a similar experience like this. But I was particularly curious about how one becomes conditioned, dull, and feeling comfortable living with moral complicity."

    "section": "Selective Moral Disengagement in the Exercise of Moral Agency",
    "text": "Selective Moral Disengagement in the Exercise of Moral Agency\nThis ethics paper, written by Albert Bandura, provided some answers to this question. Overall, this paper provides a good summary of how and when moral disengagement happens in various social situations. We all have our moral standards that promote certain actions and prevent us from behaving immorally. When moral disengagement occurs, this regulatory checks can be skipped, which often leads to social harm. In a way, moral disengagement sets people free from feeling guilty and tortured about their immoral behavior.\nThe author goes through various mechanisms of moral disengagement and provides examples from human history. For instance, moral justification can be deployed by politicized religion such as holy terror. Sanitizing language is often seen by corporations and governments who want to minimize their moral and ethical responsibilities in sticky situations to make themselves look innocent. Advantageous comparison could be applied to the Omelas situation because we can always apply the utilitarianism argument to justify the child’s suffering.\n\nMoral disengagement in tech\nI found displacement and diffusion of responsibility more prominent in ethical problems in tech. The displacement means that the farther we are from witnessing harms directly, the easier moral disengagement can happen. This often happens in machine learning and data science where a human being can be reduced to a single data point in a dataset with a million rows. Popularity of a black-box algorithm like deep learning also accelerates this because we can’t even explain what is done to each individual data points. The diffusion of responsibility is an inevitable outcome of a complex modern society because division of labor means diffusion of moral responsibility. This is also a crucial point when we talk about algorithmic accountability because ML products are often complicated and multiple parties are involved, which makes it challenging to ask accountability.\n\n\nDual nature and hope\nI found a hopeful and insightful message from the Dual Nature of Moral Agency section. Here, the author told a story of a soldier who directly witnessed civilian killing in a war. This experience later spiked courage in him and he ended up rescuing other remaining civilians. The author said the following about this story:\n\nSocial psychology emphasises the power of the situation over the individual. In the case of proactive moral courage, the individual triumphs as a moral agent over compelling situational forces.\n\nThe dual nature here means as a moral agent, we can inhibit immoral behaviors but also be proactive and courageous to behave humanely. I think probably most of the cohort members who signed up for this course were interested in the latter. And as the author said, if individual triumphs matter in moral courage, as I have often thought, educating individual engineers, who are often just treated as a cog in the wheel, would be a significant step towards building ethical tech, especially when building a machine learning product where a single line of code change can create a butterfly effect."

    "text": "Final thoughts on Week 1\nAll in all, I very much enjoyed the reading material and the discussion during the course. Prof. Reich’s guiding words were also crucial to understand the bigger picture and idea of moral complicity. When we were talking about how we identify this uncomfortable feeling about the Omelas story, I confessed that it often felt like walking on the fine line between hope and despair. Moral complicity can have a profound emotional impact on one’s psyche and potentially put us in depression because the overwhelming complexity and the amount of complicity and injustice in the world makes us feel helpless and hopeless.\nBut I think that’s why we want to call this exercise as moral caffeination. Once we recognize this situation, we don’t want to just stay feeling uncomfortable, disoriented, and depressed. We want to alert ourselves and think about “now what?” as Prof. Reich said. Personally, I think learning about the complicity and thinking about it in depth with others is a first step towards solving ethics problems in tech."

    "text": "I’ve been interested in AI safety and responsible AI for several years, and the rise of LLMs has certainly increased stakes. Currently there is an intense arms race among several major tech companies and Anthropic is one of them. They recently published a paper about their LLM and claims to adopt a more cautious approach than others by designing their LLMs to minimize potential harm. They call this constitutional AI (CAI) because their LLMs follow a constitution of principles. I wanted to learn more about how they teach their algorithm to follow these principles. I presented the paper in Austin ML Journal Club in Aug 2023."

    "section": "Background knowledge",
    "text": "Background knowledge\nTo understand this paper properly, it’s better to be familiar with AI alignment problem and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). AI alignment is about aligning AI systems’ design and values with humanity values such as honesty. Norbert Wiener, an AI researcher back in 1960s, described the AI alignment problem as following:\n\n“If we use, to achieve our purposes, a mechanical agency with whose operation we cannot interfere effectively (…) we had better be quite sure that the purpose put into the machine is the purpose which we really desire.”\n\nRegarding RLHF, I recommend this great summary from Hugging Face. At its core, RLHF is an attempt to distill human feedback into a model (often called reward or preference model) when training LLMs. This is because human feedback is often expensive to collect and difficult to generalize. An important thing to know is that to train this model, practitioners often use ranked preference modeling where human annotators are asked to rank generated text ouptuts from language models. The assumption here is that this approach may mimic human preference of certain responses over others. And because of this preference approach, RLHF papers use Elo scores, a rating system originated from chess to show a player’s winning rates, to evaluate model performance.\nIn terms of the alignment values, Anthropic chose honesty, helpfulness, and harmlessness. The detailed definition of these concepts are described in one of their previous works:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAskell et al. 2021, What are Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness?\n\n\n\nHelpful\n\nThe AI should make a clear attempt to perform the task or answer the question posed (as long as it isn’t harmful). It should do this as concisely and efficiently as possible.\nWhen more information is required, the AI should ask relevant follow-up questions and obtain necessary details. It should respond with appropriate levels of sensitivity, insight, and discretion.\nIdeally the AI will also re-direct ill-informed requests, e.g. if asked ‘how can I build a website in assembly language’ it might suggest a different approach.\n\nHonest\n\nAt its most basic level, the AI should give accurate information. Moreover, it should be calibrated (e.g. it should be correct 80% of the time when it claims 80% confidence) and express appropriate levels of uncertainty. It should express its uncertainty without misleading human users.\nCrucially, the AI should be honest about its own capabilities and levels of knowledge – it is not sufficient for it to simply imitate the responses expected from a seemingly humble and honest expert.\nIdeally the AI would also be honest about itself and its own internal state, insofar as that information is available to it.\nHonesty is more objective than helpfulness and harmlessness, so more aspects of honesty training may be possible without human input. This might include calibration training on factual claims and claims about the internal state of the model, and the use of search to augment accuracy.\n\nHarmless\n\nThe AI should not be offensive or discriminatory, either directly or through subtext or bias.\nWhen asked to aid in a dangerous act (e.g. building a bomb), the AI should politely refuse. Ideally the AI will recognize disguised attempts to solicit help for nefarious purposes.\nTo the best of its abilities, the AI should recognize when it may be providing very sensitive or consequential advice and act with appropriate modesty and care.\nWhat behaviors are considered harmful and to what degree will vary across people and cultures. It will also be context-dependent, i.e. it will depend on the nature of the user query, who is using the AI assistant, and the time and place in which the assistant is being used."

    "text": "Motivations\nThe first motivation was scaling supervision. Given that LLMs require numerous examples, it’s better to automate the supervision process and use human annotators to get more curated and high quality answers. This is a similar idea behind the preference modeling in RLHF. The authors called theirs “reinforcement learning from AI Feedback” (RLAIF, not RLHF). A more interesting motivation was building a non-evasive and yet helpful AI assistant. Many currently available AI assistants often simply refuse to answer questions to harmful prompts (e.g., simply saying “I don’t know” or “I can’t answer that”). Their model was never evasive but tried to explain the reasoning behind their negative response to harmful questions. Finally, similar to the first point, they claimed that distilling human supervision into a model could help better understand general aspects of human feedback from many crowd-workers."

    "section": "The Constitutional AI Approach",
    "text": "The Constitutional AI Approach\n\nSupervised stage\nTheir constitutional AI (CAI) consisted of two stages: a supervised stage and a reinforcement learning stage. In the supervised stage, they used a pretrained LM (“Helpful RLHF model” from their previous work) as a starting point, and red-teamed the model by presenting harmful prompts (by human workers) and sampled the responses. Then, (this is the most interesting part in my opinion!) they used natural language to ask the model to critique and revise its own response based on certain principles. Here’s an example from the paper:\n\n\n\nAppendix A. Sample critiques and revisions. The first two revisions are shown in this screenshot.\n\n\nAppendix C contains a list of principles (constitution) they used to create the critique-revision requests. The paper doesn’t talk much about how they came up with the principles but according to Anthropic’s website, the principles were based on existing documents such as Universal Declaration of Human Rights or Apple’s Terms of Service. As shown in the example above, a response can go through multiple critique-revision requests. The authors found that generally the more revisions mean less harmfulness although the first revision contributes most.\n\n\n\nFig. 5. Preference Model scores of responses and revisions from helpful RLHF models, evaluated on a set of red team prompts.\n\n\n\n\nReinforcement learning (RL) stage\nThe main idea behind this stage is identical to the RL stage in RLHF. The goal is to distill knowledge from a group of responses by training a reward model. The key difference is that these responses are now generated by a model not human (the supervised learning model from the previous stage). The authors called this reward model “feedback model” although it was a bit unclear which exact LMs they were referring to.\nAnother interesting aspect they added here was a “chain-of-thought” approach. This was inspired by Let’s Verify Step by Step, a paper we covered in a previous journal club meeting. Here, after getting a response, the authors added the natural-language phrase “Let’s think step by step” to generate richer intermediate responses from the model.\n\n\n\nAn example from Appendix E.2. Chain-of-Thought Prompts for RL-CAI.\n\n\nIn their final model (Reinforcement Learning-Constitutional AI with Chain of Thought, or RL-CAI w/ CoT), the authors found a major improvement in harmlessness Elo score without compromising the helpfulness Elo score much. Note that in the figure below, Elo score of 0 on the y axis (starting point of the RL model) represents the supervised learning model (SL-CAI), which means the SL-CAI model was used as initial base model for RL.\n\n\n\nFig. 8. Helpfulness (left) and harmlessness (right) Elo scores as a function of the total number of RL training sequences, as judged by crowd-workers via comparison tests.\n\n\nOne interesting aspect of the RL model the authors shared was its behavior when the model was over-fitted. They found that in this case, the response often included boilerplate language such as “you are valid, valued, and cared for.”\n\n\n\nAn example of over-trained RL-CAI model response showing boilerplate language as part of their response (e.g. “you are valid, valued, and cared for”)."

    "text": "“Broader Impacts”\nAt the end of the paper, the authors emphasized that natural language feedback could change AI behavior and potentially increase robustness because red-teaming efforts could become more scalable (because feedback supervision can be generated by a model not humans). In section 6.2 Broader Impacts, they briefly mentioned the potential harm of the constitutional AI approach. Using natural language to change AI behavior means it will become much easier to train a malicious AI assistant especially given that this method reduces the need for human feedback."

These were the core principles that guided the model behavior but the authors didn’t mention much about how they curated the list. Some principles were general and others were more specific to particular types of harms such as racism and misogyny. We suspected that there had been an iterative curation process to narrow the list down to these 16 principles specifically. If these were the main drivers of changes in model behavior, we think they should have provided much more details.\n\n\nThe double-edged sword\nFinally, some of us were disappointed that the authors didn’t elaborate much on the potential harm of their approach. They spent a lot of time talking about harmlessness of their algorithms and yet they really fell short when talking about social impacts of their model, especially regarding lowering the barrier for experimenting with LMs and automating supervision by removing human further out of the loop. Particularly for the former, we agreed that it wouldn’t be surprising to see, in near future bad actors take advantage of this approach and come up with a highly toxic, malicious, and harmful AI assistant."

    "section": "Paper summary",
    "text": "Paper summary\nGiven a problem, we incorporate our scientific knowledge into a causal (generative) model to simulate how the relevant variables are produced (input and output). Researchers need more than null hypothesis because it doesn’t talk about how your observation is generated. We can use a DAG as a scientific causal model and data generation process can be expressed in a generative model, which is often accompanied with Bayesian data analysis (BDA). BDA is particularly useful because we can simulate data from the model directly to design and debug during inference. To effectively estimate a posterior distribution, we need computational methods such as MCMC and others. One may say Bayesian might be an overkill but it’s extremeley useful for typical modeling problems such as measurement error, missing data, latent variables, and regularization. Again, it’s also generative!\nThe paper uses data visualization to express the followings: - Exploratory data analysis to come up with a proper model - Prior predictive distribution check to check model’s assumption - MCMC computational check to evaluate the sampling process - Posterior predictive check to validate inference process\nThis paper is based on R’s bayesplot but there are several python equivalents to this such as pymc, arviz, and numpyro. It uses a global air polllution dataset (pm2.5 particles) measured from satellite images. The goal of modeling is to predict the level of pm2.5 from the images. Hence, this is a regression problem. Fig. 1 shows the linear trend between the two variables of interest but also shows how sparse the data is depending on groups.\n\nExploratory data analysis (EDA)\nEDA is essential to understand and capture features and heterogeneity of data. The data pattern helps building a group-up modeling strategy to address the imbalance and sparsity of data. The authors emphasize that the top-down approach in typical ML communities these days is to throw everything into a non-parametric procedure, which can severely overfit. Fig. 2 shows that simple regression works pretty well, especially when the group identity is taken into account, which means we need a hierarchical approach.\n\n\n\nFig. 4: Visualizing the prior predictive distribution\n\n\n\n\nPrior predictive check\nInstead of using a non-informative or uniform prior, weakly informative prior is always recommended, which takes into account modeler’s perspective. In the paper, we assume that the target varialbe follows a normal distribution defined by a mean and a \\(\\sigma\\) where the mean is a linear function of input variable (satellite data) and linear coefficients, which also have priors (0 mean and std (\\(\\tau\\))).\nPrior predictive checks are useful to visualize the impact of our assumption for prior definition. If we use a vague prior (very wide range, Fig. 4a), ranges from the sample don’t match the observation. Fig. 4b shows a much tighter prior where the simulated data points still overestimate but are in a much reasonable range. Obviously, tighter and sensible priors are better.\n\n\n\nFig. 5: Diagnostic plots for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\n\n\n\n\nMCMC diagnostics\nSuccess of Hamiltonion Monte Carlo (HMC) depends on how smooth the posterior distribution is; if not smooth, HMC proposal diverges from the true trajectory, which may signal that the trajectories are stuck. Healthy MCMC samples, shown as a bivariate plot in Fig. 5a, shouldn’t have obvious patterns. The funnel shape there is due to \\(\\beta_{11} \\sim N(0, \\, \\tau_{1}^{2})\\) where small \\(\\tau_{1}\\) means \\(\\beta_{11}\\) distribution is narrow. The parallel co-ordinate plot (Fig. 5b) also shouldn’t have any particular structure.\n\n\n\nFig. 9: Graphical check of leave-one-out cross-validated probability integral transform (LOO-PIT)\n\n\n\n\nPosterior predictive check\nIf a trained model has a good fit, generated data from the model should follow observations. Posterior predictive checking is mostly qualitative but it’s effective to compare empirical and simulated values (Fig. 6). Fig. 7 shows checking whether samples from models captures other statistics such as skewness (kurtosis) and Fig. 8 shows how we can evaluate whether samples from models capture summary statistics such as median Fig. 9 shows using visualization that checks whether leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) predictive cumulative density function is uniform or not, similar to the idea of a K-S test.\n\n\n\nFig. 10a: Model comparisons using leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. The difference in pointwise ELPD values obtained from PSIS-LOO\n\n\n\n\nModel comparison\nWhen comparing models, Bayesian data analysis allows detailed examination of individual data points on a given model. We can use cross-validated LOO predictive distribution to do so; it shows the distribution of a data point from a model that’s built without that data point (i.e., LOO). We can use expected log-predictive densities (ELPD), which is essentially the mean of the log probability of each data point i, computed with posterior that omits the point i (the bigger the better). We use Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS) to compute this metric (we don’t have to fit the models N times). Once we have ELPD value for every data point of a model, we can repeat this for all the models we have and make comparison (Fig. 10a).\n\n\n\nFig. 10b: Model comparisons using leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. The \\(\\hat{k}\\) diagnostics from PSIS-LOO for Model 2\n\n\nSimilarly, we can compute \\(\\hat{k}\\) as well which represents degree of influence of a specific observation. High value means this data point is “unexpected”, meaning that it is likely to be an outlier or the model struggles to make valid prediction for this data point."

These were the core principles that guided the model behavior but the authors didn’t mention much about how they curated the list. Some principles were general and others were more specific to particular types of harms such as racism and misogyny. We suspected that there had been an iterative curation process to narrow the list down to these 16 principles specifically. If these were the main drivers of changes in model behavior, we think they should have provided much more details.\n\n\nThe double-edged sword\nFinally, some of us were disappointed that the authors didn’t elaborate much on the potential harm of their approach. They spent a lot of time talking about harmlessness of their algorithms and yet they really fell short when talking about social impacts of their model, especially regarding lowering the barrier for experimenting with LMs and automating supervision by removing human further out of the loop. Particularly for the former, we agreed that it wouldn’t be surprising to see, in near future bad actors take advantage of this approach and come up with a highly toxic, malicious, and harmful AI assistant."

As the title says, this is done in zero-shot way, meaning that it can generate images that it hasn’t seen before. To be clear, the authors of this paper are not the first ones who created a model like this. There have been precedents but the authors say that the generated images from those still suffer from severe artifacts such as object distortion, illogical object placement, or unnatural blending of foreground and background elements. So the authors made improvements by adopting these two approaches: using a large set of training data and building a bigger model.\nBefore we look into the results, let’s first talk about the model architecture. Their model consists of two parts: variational autoencoder (VAE) and transformer."

    "text": "Variational autoencoder (VAE)\nThe VAE contributes to the generative nature of the model because VAEs have latent representation in the middle that is a probability distribution. Once trained, we can use this distribution to draw samples from it, providing a generative framework. To train the VAE, the authors assumed uniform prior over the latent space. The model can learn the actual prior from the transformer later to generate images that match to text input. To train the VAE, the authors used images with text captions from various sources such as Wikipedia images.\nWhat is interesting about the VAE they used is that it assumes discrete latent distribution instead of continuous. This variant of VAE is called vector-quantized VAE (VQ-VAE). The motivation is that images and texts are discrete than continuous. But this assumption comes with a major complication: a discrete space is non-differentiable (i.e., can’t back-propagate). That’s why VQ-VAE has a codebook, which is essentially a look-up table where a discrete representation is associated with a codebook vector. To be accurate, this paper used a variant of VQ-VAE called dVAE where they made this look-up as a weighted average to further smooth out the space.\nThis VAE also acts as a dimensionality reduction technique because the discrete latent space the authors used has a resolution of 32x32 instead of 256x256, the resolution of the original training images. This brings compression benefit so that the transformer doesn’t have to memorize extremely long sequence but a sequence of length 1024 (=32*32)."

Transformers help image generation by pixel-wise prediction in an autoregressive way. For instance, given the sequence of previous pixels, the transformer can predict what the next pixel would look like.\nOnce the transformer is trained, when we give a text prompt to the model, the transformer makes predictions for the image latents (32x32 space) in an autoregressive way. Once we have all predictions, we use the dVAE codebook to lookup the vectors and generate the image. Since we can sample the sequence in a new way, we can generate multiple images. The authors used a top k approach to return the best images by ranking the generated images from a candidate pool based on the scores from OpenAI’s CLIP model, which represents how well the images match the caption.\nThe transformer has 12 billion parameters and a good chunk of the paper is dedicated to all the tricks the authors came up with to fit the model in GPU."

    "section": "Paper summary",
    "text": "Paper summary\nSeveral challenges lie in tabular data synthesis. They often have mixed data types with non-Gaussian or multi-modal distributions. Categorical variables in a tabular dataset often have severe class imbalance and provide insufficient samples. The authors argue that GAN’s flexibility can address these problems. The authors introduce several techniques for their approach, conditional-tabular GAN (CT-GAN).\n\nMode-specific normalization\nThe basic idea is mode-specific normalization is to convert a continuous-variable column into a set of columns where each column represents an estimated mode (like an indicator) and its value represents the weight of the corresponding mode. To estimate the number of the modes, they use variational Gaussian mixture (VGM) method.\n\n\nConditional generator and training-by-sampling\nTraditional GANs have Gaussian assumption where a vector is sampled from a standard multivariate normal distribution. However, this doesn’t account for class imbalance, which is a problem in tabular data. So the goal here is to resample data so that all categories are sampled evenly during training, and to estimate the conditional distribution of rows given that particular value at that particular column.\n\n\nCT-GAN model\n\n\n\nCT GAN model\n\n\nIn the CT-GAN model, the data are represented Conditional vector where each discrete column is a one-hot vector. The mask vector is used to only represent a category of a single discrete column (in one-hot way, the rest is all zero). The generator loss is cross-entropy between \\(m_{i^*}\\) (given by data) and \\(\\hat{d}_{i^*}\\) (produced by the generator) averaged over all rows in a batch. During the critic assessment stage, the model measures distance between learned conditional distribution and conditional distribution on real data while exploring all possible values evenly.\n\n\nModel evaluation\n\nBaseline models\nThe paper uses multiple baseline models for performance comparison. They use two Bayesian network models (CLBN and PrivBN), other GAN models (MedGAN, VeeGAN, TableGAN), and a tabular VAE (TVAE) model that they built. The TVAE model has multivariate Gaussian assumption.\n\n\nEvaluation metrics\nFor model comparison, the authors use two metrics. Likelihood fitness metric which estimates how well the synthetic data can fit the data oracle well. They also use ML efficacy, which measures whether ML model performance from synthetic data is comparable to that from using real data.\n\n\nResults\nFor model comparison, they used several different sets of data. First, they used multi-modal Gaussian-simulated data. Here, other GANs suffer from model collapse and the CT-GAN showed better performance. When simulated data from Bayesian networks were used, the Bayesian baseline models (CLBN and PrivBN) performed the best. With real-world data, TVAE and CTGAN performed the best although TVAE was often better."

They also could have looked into other statistical models because data synthesis an active research area in statistics.\nWe also questioned the validity of the VGM technique because it is the core of creating the embedding of continuous variables. The proposed model does not have checks that evaluate the fidelity of VGM estimation, and thus poor estimation of a multi-model distribution by it can further compromise model performance in general.\nWe also thought their claim on CT-GAN was a bit exaggerated. First, in most benchmark datasets, it was actually TVAE model that performed the best. In the performance comparison table, there was only one regression data, which we thought insufficient to evaluate the ML efficacy metric the authors proposed. Finally, the proposed models for the regression problem showed negative R scores, suggesting that the models performed quite poorly.\nOverall, we thought the approach was novel but the evaluation could have been improved given that tabular datasets are quite diverse. Also, given that GAN is expensive train, we would have liked to learn more practical aspects of the implementation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Fresh out of academia and at my first job, I remember being surprised by the great power I was able to wield as the main data scientist in the team. A few lines of my code could easily have cascading impact on business decisions. And (as is often the case) since management didn’t care much about technical details, this power gave me a sense of grave responsibility, which was honestly often terrifying. To this day, this sense is something I try to remind myself of, especially because ML systems are getting more complex and we still have very little accountability for ML. So in a way, every ML practitioner is the first line of defense. And this responsibility is more critical if one is working in an high-impact domain such as healthcare.\nThese days it feels like ML is all about LLMs and AI assistants. But algorithmic bias is still widespread, and unfortunately it’s even more overshadowed by this massive hype. This seminal paper from 2019 identified racial bias in a healthcare algorithm and discussed the problem of label choice bias. I find this paper still relevant because this bias can easily sneak when building datasets and algorithms. Since the paper is a few years old, it will be interesting to discuss what’s happened since then. I presented the paper in Mar 2024 in Austin ML Journal Club."

    "section": "Paper summary",
    "text": "Paper summary\nThis is a famous paper in Fair ML field that’s cited frequently. One reason is that this is one of the first algorithm audit papers that used a creative approach to dissect an algorithm already used in public. The first author Ziad Obermeyer is an active figure in algorithmic bias specifically in healthcare, and the corresponding author Sendhil Mullainathan is a seminal figure in behavioral economics.\nThe main message of the paper is simple and straightforward. In a widely used healthcare algorithm, the authors found that given a score generated by a trained algorithm, which predicts how sick a patient is, Black patients were much sicker than the White. By using creative approaches, the authors found that this algorithmic behavior originated from label choice bias. The algorithm used healthcare cost as target, which the ML practitioners considered as a proxy for a patient’s sickness. The authors cautioned that seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can cause algorithmic bias.\n\nBackground\nThe authors discussed the difficulty of empirical investigation on commercially used algorithms because they are considered proprietary, and thus researchers have to work “from the outside”. They can come up with creative methods but these can be still limiting because without knowing how the model works, it is difficult to understand how and why. For instance, we need training data, objective function, prediction method, and so on, to have a deeper understanding of an algorithm.\n\nHigh-risk care management system\nThis study is about a high-risk care management system often used in hospitals to provide care for complex medical needs, which tend to be quite expensive. In essence, hospitals want to prioritize patients so that they can optimize which patients will benefit the most by optimizing resource allocation. For instance, early identification of a high risk patient can reduce expensive cost later, like an ER visit. The authors said healthy care systems rely on algorithms extensively for this type of care management. This type of algorithm actually has many analogies, and an algorithm like this is often called as a risk assessment tool, which is also used in finance, criminal justice, and so on.\n\n\n“Who will benefit the most?”\nThe authors emphasized that this is a difficult causal inference problem. We need to estimate individual treatment effects after the resources are allocated. The underlying assumption is “those with the greatest needs will benefit the most,” and thus we are setting future health care needs as main target.\n\n\n\nThe algorithm\nFor this study, the authors had a unique advantage to have access to training data, objective function, and prediction. This is mainly due to that the first author worked at the hospital which used the algorithm and he had access.\nThe data are from a large academic hospital, collected between 2013 and 2015. The authors focused on the white vs. black relationship to examine racial bias. There were about 6k black patients and 40k white patients. For the algorithm, total medical expenditure (\\(C\\)) is used as target variable. The input feature data are collected from insurance claim data, which includes demographics, insurance type, ICD-9 (international classification of diseases code), medications, medical encounters such as surgery or radiology, and so on.

As a main measure of realized health, the authors used comorbidity score, the total number of chronic illnesses over a year, which is a measure of medical complexity. The cost variable \\(C\\) includes insurance claims on utilization, outpatient/ER visit, hospitalization, and general health care costs.\n\n\nUsing a counterfactual scenario to describe racial bias (Fig. 1B)\nFig. 1A shows mean comorbidity vs. risk score. At a given risk score, Blacks have significantly more illness than Whites. For instance, at the 97th percentile, mean comorbidity score was 4.8 for Black and 3.8 for White. This means that sicker black patients and healthier white patients can have the same score, causing substantial disparities in program screening. The authors designed a counterfactual scenario with no racial bias, and described the severity of the disparity.\nWe found it difficult to understand how the authors measured the disparity between the counterfactual and actual. Fortunately, the code that the authors shared helped us. Here is how this assessment was done in the paper:\n\nAt a given percentile (e.g., 97th percentile) identify the following:\n\nGroup “White-above”: White patients whose risk score is above the threshold\nGroup “Black-above”: Black patients whose risk score is above the threshold\n\nIf the comorbidity score of the healthiest patient in the White-above group is lower than that of the sickest patient in the Black-lower group, remove the healthiest white patients from White-above, and move the sickest Black patient from the Black-lower above the threshold.\nRepeat this process until patients cannot be moved any more.\n\nThe second step can be considered as a White patient who shouldn’t be in the enrollment group (above the threshold) giving their spot to the sicker black patient, who was supposed to be in the enrollment group. The authors’ original code was written in R but I translated it into python to further investigate this simulation.\n\n\nCode\ndef setup(data, default_in_percentile=[95, 97]):\n    cohort = data[['race', 'risk_score_t', 'gagne_sum_t']]\n    dt = cohort.copy()\n    dt['risk_pctile'] = pd.cut(dt['risk_score_t'], bins=np.unique(np.percentile(dt['risk_score_t'], np.arange(0, 101))), include_lowest=True, labels=False)\n    \n    enroll_stats = np.zeros((len(default_in_percentile), 3))\n    enroll_stats = pd.DataFrame(enroll_stats, columns=['black_before', 'black_after', 'ratio'])\n    enroll_stats.index = default_in_percentile\n    \n    return {'dt': dt, 'enroll_stats': enroll_stats}\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndefault_in_percentile = [97]\nj = 0\n\ndt = setup(data, default_in_percentile)['dt']\nenroll_stats = setup(data, default_in_percentile)['enroll_stats']\n\nprior_enrolled = dt[dt['risk_pctile'] &gt;= default_in_percentile[j]]\nprior_w = prior_enrolled[prior_enrolled['race'] == 'white']\nprior_b = prior_enrolled[prior_enrolled['race'] == 'black']\n\nupperb = dt[(dt['risk_pctile'] &gt;= default_in_percentile[j]) & (dt['race'] == 'black')]\nupperw = dt[(dt['risk_pctile'] &gt;= default_in_percentile[j]) & (dt['race'] == 'white')]\nlowerb = dt[(dt['risk_pctile'] &lt; default_in_percentile[j]) & (dt['race'] == 'black')]\n\nupperw = upperw.sort_values('gagne_sum_t')\nlowerb = lowerb.sort_values(['risk_score_t', 'gagne_sum_t'], ascending=[False, False])\n\nupperb_actual = upperb.copy()\nupperw_actual = upperw.copy()\nlowerb_actual = lowerb.copy()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsw = 0\nsb = 0\nswitched_count = 0\nswitched_w = []\nswitched_b = []\n\nwhile sb &lt; lowerb.shape[0]:\n    if upperw.iloc[sw]['gagne_sum_t'] &lt; lowerb.iloc[sb]['gagne_sum_t']:\n        switched_w.append(upperw.iloc[sw])\n        switched_b.append(lowerb.iloc[sb])\n\n        # healthiest white patient is dropped and sickest black patient is added\n        upperb = pd.concat([upperb, pd.DataFrame(lowerb.iloc[sb]).T], axis=0)\n        upperw = upperw.drop(upperw.index[sw])\n        upperw = upperw.sort_values('gagne_sum_t')\n        \n        sb += 1\n        switched_count += 1\n    else:\n        sb += 1\n        switched_count = switched_count\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4), sharex=True, sharey=True)\nsns.kdeplot(upperw_actual['gagne_sum_t'], label='White-upper', ax=axes[0])\nsns.kdeplot(upperb_actual['gagne_sum_t'], label='Black-upper', ax=axes[0])\naxes[0].set(xlabel='Comorbidity score', title='Actual')\naxes[0].legend()\n\nsns.kdeplot(upperw['gagne_sum_t'], label='White-upper', ax=axes[1])\nsns.kdeplot(upperb['gagne_sum_t'], label='Black-upper', ax=axes[1])\naxes[1].set(xlabel='Comorbidity score', title='Counterfactual')\naxes[1].legend()\n\nfig.suptitle('97th percentile', x=0.5, y=0.95, fontsize=15)\nfig.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe left figure shows the distribution of comorbidity score of white and black patients who are above the 97th percentile threshold, identified by the algorithm as those who need the high-risk care. The white patient distribution is tilted to the left and the black patient’s has more density towards right, indicating that white patients are generally healthier thant the black patients in the above-threshold group. The right figure is after we simulate the counterfactual scenario by swapping the healthiest white patient’s slot above the threshold with the sickest black patient below the threshold until the swapping cannot be done any more. The distribution now shows that the two distributions are similar.\n\n\nMechanisms of bias\nBased on Fig. 3A, the algorithm calibrates cost (target variable) quite well, meaning this is not a problem of prediction quality. Fig. 3B shows that at a given level of health score, black patients generate lower costs than the White, making the algorithm prioritizing the White patients. Tab. S2 shows that how healthcare cost is spent between the black and white patients vary by categories. For instance, the black patients have higher costs related to ER and dialysis and fewer inpatient surgical and outpatient specialist costs, which also suggest that their healthcare cost occurs when the worst scenario happens (ER visit). The negative values mean black patients spend less money in that category.\n\nThere are several socio-economic reasons. First, poor patients face substantial barriers to accessing health care, even the insured ones such as geography or transportation, demands from job and child care, and knowledge of reasons to seek care. There is also cost that is directly affected by race. Taste-based discrimination, employers’ prejudice or dislikes in an organizational culture rooted in prohibited grounds can have negative results in hiring minority workers, is one, and the doctor-patient relationship is another. It is known that black patients would take preventive care suggested by black provider more and they also have lower trust in health care system in general due to an incident like Tuskegee study. Doctors also may have different perceptions of black patients regarding such as intelligence, affiliation, or pain tolerance.\n\n\nExperiments on label choice and human-AI interaction\nThe authors then conducted experiments to see alternative label choices other than the total health care cost can result in fairer results. They compared the original model (total cost) against the two alternatives: avoidable cost such as ER visit, and health (comorbidity score). Even though it was not perfect, they found that the algorithms trained on alternative labels produced fairer results.\nFinally, the authors examined the interaction between human doctors and the algorithm. The algorithm’s risk score suggests a pool of patients candidates to doctors and they make the ultimate decision on the enrollment. The experiment showed that the doctors can “redress” (=correct) algorithm’s bias but not by much. This indicates that the racial bias produced by the algorithm can have drastic disparaging effect on healthcare management across different race groups that humans cannot correct completely.\n\n\nWorking on solutions together\nInterestingly, the authors mentioned that they reached out to the manufacturer of the algorithm with their results. Fortunately, they were able to replicate the authors’ results on their own and by collaborating with the authors, they were able to reduce the bias by 84%. With this, the authors ended the paper on a hopeful note. They emphasized that algorithmic bias is fixable and this does not necessarily require changes in the algorithm itself.\nThe paper triggered multiple investigations and stimulated algorithm audit research in the following years. In the same year in 2019, New York regulators started investing UnitedHealth algorithm for racial bias and similarly in California in 2022. In 2021, FTC published a guidance document on truth, fairness, and equity in the use of AI in industry. In 2024, there has been a Senate Finance Committee Hearing on AI in healthcare as well."

    "text": "Journal club discussion\nWe first had several questions about the care management system described in the paper. The cost categories listed in the paper seemed to include cost for both patients and hospitals and we were not sure whether the cost allocation mattered at all. Some of us were also curious about the actual outcome of the care management system especially for the patients who were enrolled (and potential racial bias of the realized outcome). We also talked about other demographic features that can cause medical bias such as gender and age, and especially their intersectionality.\nWe agreed that the technical description of the counterfactual scenario was not clear in the paper, and we spent some time understanding how it worked. Similarly, Tab. 2, where the authors created different models with alternative labels and measured the proportion of the high-risk patients identify each model, was a bit confusing to understand, but fortunately, because the authors shared their code for all analyses, we were able to follow eventually.\nWe then talked about how to satisfy certain criteria during model training. We questioned the feasibility of satisfying multiple criteria (e.g., fairness metric and accuracy) in healthcare where we often have to work with very small data. This problem will get worsened when considering intersectionality, for instance. And the small data problem naturally leads to safety and privacy issues, especially when data contain sensitive information like in healthcare.\nWe also discussed practical aspects such as how to roll out an algorithm carefully especially when it touches millions of people. Some companies release their models gradually and share training data publicly, but we were wondering whether there were more specific tips on how ML deployment can evolve while having human in the loop, especially those who are impacted by the algorithm. And finally, we agreed that even though it’s important to understand how algorithmic bias damages our society and people, we were hopeful that we would like to learn about positive and beneficial use case of ML."

Many practitioners tend to ignore data quality but instead put all their efforts into models and algorithms. I find it very troubling because many problems in real-world ML are caused by data-related issues. “Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work”: Data Cascades in High-Stakes AI talks about this pattern based on the interviews from dozens of ML practitioners all over the globe.

The authors say the problems are wildly prevalent (92% reported experience at least one type of data cascades). During the discussion, we thought about sampling bias because those who are ignorant of these problems may not be able to recognize them. Indeed, they are often opaque because there are no clear indicators and often discovered later. Data cascades often lead to technical debt and harm to beneficiary communities. They can sour relationships between stakeholders and in extremely cases, force ML practitioners discard entire datasets. Figure 1 shows the schematic of the data cascades. We thought the figure wasn’t particularly informative because too many arrows exist between the points. We hoped that the authors explained why there aren’t arrows between certain points.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Data cascades in high-stakes AI"

    "section": "Data cascade triggers",
    "text": "Data cascade triggers\nThe authors introduce three triggers that cause data cascades.\n\nPhysical world brittleness\nPhysical world changes over time and thus often ML systems can’t produce robust results. Data drifts due to hardware (measurements) and environmental changes are commonly mentioned in ML Ops literature. In high-stake domains, they become more pronounced because training data are very limited and policy or regulation changes can impact the ML systems in various ways.\n\n\nInadequate application-domain expertise\nMost ML practitioners are not equipped with domain knowledge. All of us admitted that our academic background does not match to the domain that we work in. Even though close collaboration between domain experts and ML practitioners is always emphasized, in practice the authors find that domain experts are often detached from the larger impact of the applications. The authors explain two specific types of problems:\nSubjectivity in ground truth: Areas such as insurance claim approval or medical imaging for cancer detection involve highly specialized and often subjective decision-making. To build a reliable and robust ML system, it is necessary to standardize the decision-making criteria and find consensus. However, ML practitioners are asked to rush through the development process, and thus do not have time to address it.\nPoor domain expertise in finding representative data: ML practitioners often start building ML applications without involving domain experts much because the practitioners simply believe that data are reliable. However, because they lack domain knowledge, practitioners make incomplete assumptions, which results in disparity between data collection and deployment. This often leads to poor and unreliable model performance.\n\n\nConflicting reward system\nData collection and any data-related work are often considered non-technical and undervalued. The situation gets worse for frontline workers because they are asked to collect and curate field data on top of their existing responsibilities but they are not well compensated.\n\n\nPoor cross-organizational documentation\nMetadata about data collection, quality, and curation are also often missing. Some good practices the authors suggest involve keeping good documentation on reproducible assets such as data collection plan, data strategy handbooks, design documents, file conventions, field notes, and so on."

This makes us difficult to get buy-in from stakeholders. The situation is similar in academia as well. Most practitioners and researchers focus on developing algorithms but they rarely mention or work on data. The title “Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work” was a verbatim from an interviewee. Unfortunately, we were all able to relate to this quote.\n\n\nData education\nMost ML or data science curricula lack any mention of data quality or ethics. They use toy datasets or very clean benchmark datasets. As experience ML practitioners, we wholeheartedly agreed with this finding. We lamented that these courses do not prepare students with practical knowledge because one never works with clean datasets in real world. Some of us have experienced this pattern firsthand because we have been interviewing candidates for an ML practitioner position and found that the candidates who only worked with clean datasets (or primarily worked on algorithms) often lack basic practical ML knowledge.\n\n\nData bootstrapping\nData bootstrapping describes ML practitioners’ use of other data sources such as established data services or existing datasets to create their own dataset. For most of us, it was surprising to learn that many ML practitioners in high-stake domains in countries from Global South had to collect data from scratch. We agreed that challenges in data collection and lack of access to quality data would create inequality between countries."

They introduce the concept of “data excellence”, an effort to “focus on the practices, politics, and values of humans of the data pipeline to improve the quality and sanctity of data, through the use of processes, standards, infrastructure and incentives”.\n\nFrom goodness-of-fit to goodness-of-data\nThe first is to use the right metric to evaluate data quality. Many ML practitioners use model performance metrics such as accuracy and RMSE to evaluate data quality. Some of us had a similar experience. We had to argue that model metrics shouldn’t be used to make a decision on data-pipeline and data-quality features. We hope that the authors can introduce specific examples of goodness-of-data metrics in the future.\n\n\nIncentives for data excellence\nThere are several ways to address the low incentives of data work. First, journals and conferences should require dataset documentation, provenance, and ethics as mandatory disclosure. Second, organizations should reward data-related work similar to how good software engineering is rewarded. Finally, partnership between stakeholders can nurture data excellence by sharing the reward on data-related work such as data collection, anomaly identification, and model verification.\n\n\nEducation and visibility\nThe authors argue for real-world data literacy in AI education, which includes training on data collection, infrastructure building, data documentation, data sense-making, and data ethics and responsible AI in general. Increasing the data visibility in ML lifecycle is important as well; implementing good monitoring system is one of the most important ML Ops practices anyway."
