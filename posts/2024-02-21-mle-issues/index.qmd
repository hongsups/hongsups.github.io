Focus: high level issues, what undermines ML productization and ML engineering

Basic ideas
- Lack of understanding of the nature of ML products
- ML hype comlicates the issue
- Not always about technical issues, management and collaboration affects too

Brain dump
- Upper management lack of ML engineering
  - Ignoring research
  - treating ML project as a typical software engineering product
  - there's no true handoff
  - domain experts are not looped properly
  - treating ML as magic
  - zero exploratory work
  - not understanding client needs
  - misalignment of KPIs and model optimization metrics
- Team mismanagement
  - ML/data engineering lack of support for ML work: experimentationn, a/b testing, reproducibility
  - ML engineering implementation going separate ways
  - Overly democratic process (non meritocratic and everybody is invited to all meetings); people generally feel safer in smaller meetings; dispeserion of responsibility and accountability
  - no accountability and coordination
  - lack of psychological safety to fail fast and move on
